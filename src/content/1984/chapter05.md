CHAPTER 5 SUMMARY - PART ONE

Winston has lunch in the Ministry canteen with Syme, a philologist working on the Newspeak Dictionary. Syme explains the true purpose of Newspeak:

Newspeak's Purpose:
- Destroying words, not creating them - reducing vocabulary to eliminate nuance
- "The whole aim of Newspeak is to narrow the range of thought"
- Eventually, thoughtcrime will be "literally impossible, because there will be no words in which to express it"
- Words like "bad" replaced with "ungood," "excellent" with "plusgood" or "doubleplusgood"
- By 2050, all literature (Chaucer, Shakespeare, Milton, Byron) will be rewritten in Newspeak, changing their meaning entirely
- "Orthodoxy means not thinking--not needing to think. Orthodoxy is unconsciousness."

Winston realizes Syme will be vaporized - he's too intelligent and speaks too plainly.

Parsons joins them, collecting subscriptions for Hate Week. He brags about his daughter following and reporting a stranger to the patrols for wearing unusual shoes (likely a foreigner).

The telescreen announces the chocolate ration has been raised to 20 grammes. Winston remembers it was just announced yesterday that it would be REDUCED to 20 grammes from 30. Everyone accepts this without question through doublethink.

The dark-haired girl watches Winston again, making him paranoid she's spying on him. Winston thinks about who will survive the purges: Parsons will survive (too stupid), Syme will be vaporized (too intelligent), he himself will be vaporized.
