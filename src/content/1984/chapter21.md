CHAPTER 21 SUMMARY - PART THREE

Winston is released. He now has a sinecure job and spends his days at the Chestnut Tree Cafe, drinking gin and playing chess.

He's hollow and docile. He watches the telescreen and accepts everything it says without question. He uses doublethink naturally now.

Winston occasionally sees Julia once. They meet briefly and admit they betrayed each other. "I betrayed you," she says. "I betrayed you," he echoes. They feel nothing for each other now.

Julia explains that after Room 101, you can never feel the same way again. The Party has destroyed their capacity to love each other.

They part without any emotion, and Winston knows they will never seek each other out again.

Winston reflects on how he's changed. He has learned to control his facial expressions perfectly. He follows the telescreen news with genuine enthusiasm. He has mastered doublethink.
