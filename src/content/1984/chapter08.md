CHAPTER 8 SUMMARY - PART ONE (Ends Part One)

Winston skips the Community Centre and wanders through the prole districts - a dangerous act suggesting "ownlife" (individualism). He observes the swarming life of the proles, hoping to find truth about the past.

Quest for Truth:
Winston enters a pub and tries to question an old man (80+) about life before the Revolution. The conversation is frustrating - the old man only remembers trivial details (beer prices, top hats, arguments) but cannot compare life then and now in any meaningful way. "They remembered a million useless things...but all the relevant facts were outside the range of their vision."

Winston realizes: When memory fails and records are falsified, the Party's claims become unchallengeable truth.

Mr. Charrington's Junk Shop:
Winston finds himself back at the shop where he bought his diary. He meets the proprietor, Mr. Charrington (63, a widower). Winston buys a beautiful glass paperweight with coral inside - a useless but beautiful object from the past.

Mr. Charrington shows Winston a room upstairs with no telescreen - an old bedroom. Winston fantasizes about renting it, though he knows it's impossibly dangerous.

The old man teaches Winston a fragment of a nursery rhyme: "Oranges and lemons, say the bells of St Clement's, You owe me three farthings, say the bells of St Martin's..."

The Dark-Haired Girl:
As Winston leaves, he sees the dark-haired girl from the Fiction Department on the same obscure street. He's convinced she's spying on him - either for the Thought Police or as an amateur spy. He briefly considers killing her with a cobblestone but is too exhausted.

Back home, Winston contemplates the inevitable: arrest, torture, confession, and death. He thinks of O'Brien's words: "We shall meet in the place where there is no darkness."

Part One ends with the Party slogans: WAR IS PEACE / FREEDOM IS SLAVERY / IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH
