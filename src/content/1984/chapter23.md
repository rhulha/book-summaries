Winston sits in the Chestnut Tree Cafe. The telescreen announces a great victory in Africa - Oceania has won an important battle.

Winston is playing chess and drinking his usual gin. He's been putting on weight and drinking more.

As he listens to the telescreen announce the victory, Winston looks up at the enormous face of Big Brother on the poster.

The final transformation is complete. Winston realizes he has been wrong all along. He feels genuine love and devotion.

The novel ends with one of the most chilling lines in literature:

"He loved Big Brother."

Winston's rebellion is over. The Party has won completely. His re-education is finished - not just his outward compliance, but his innermost feelings have been transformed. This is the ultimate horror of the totalitarian state: it doesn't just control your actions, it controls your thoughts and emotions. Winston believed he had an unassailable inner self, but the Party proved that even that could be destroyed and remade.

The book ends with Winston's complete psychological annihilation.
