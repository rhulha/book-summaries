CHAPTER 16 SUMMARY - PART THREE (Begins Part Three)

Winston is imprisoned in the Ministry of Love - a windowless building with harsh fluorescent lights.

The cell is crowded with various prisoners. Winston observes:
- Ordinary criminals and political prisoners mixed together
- People disappear from the cell when their names are called (taken for interrogation/execution)
- Prisoners are terrified of "Room 101"

Winston sees several people he knows arrested:
- Ampleforth (the poet) - arrested for leaving the word "God" in a Kipling translation
- Parsons - denounced by his own 7-year-old daughter for saying "Down with Big Brother" in his sleep (he's proud of her)

Prisoners are beaten if they try to feed starving prisoners or comfort each other.

Winston is weak and filthy, growing a beard. He doesn't know how long he's been imprisoned.
