Room 101 contains "the worst thing in the world" - which is different for each person. For Winston, it's rats.

O'Brien brings in a cage containing large, starving rats. The cage is designed to be strapped to Winston's face, with a door that will open and release the rats to eat through his face.

As the rats are about to be released, Winston breaks completely. In utter terror, he screams the only thing that will save him:

"Do it to Julia! Not me! Julia! I don't care what you do to her. Tear her face off, strip her to the bones. Not me! Julia! Not me!"

This is the final betrayal. Winston has not just intellectually accepted the Party's power - he has emotionally betrayed the one person he loved. This is what O'Brien needed: complete submission, where Winston sacrifices Julia to save himself.

The torture stops. Winston has passed through Room 101. He is finally broken.
