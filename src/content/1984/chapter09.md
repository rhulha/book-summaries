The dark-haired girl slips Winston a note in a Ministry corridor. The note says: "I LOVE YOU."

Winston spends an agonizing week trying to arrange a meeting. After several near-misses in the canteen, they finally manage a brief conversation. The girl instructs Winston to meet her Sunday afternoon in the countryside - giving him precise directions with "military precision."

In Victory Square, amid a crowd watching Eurasian prisoners pass by, she whispers the meeting details. They briefly hold hands in the crowd before parting.
