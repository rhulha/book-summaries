CHAPTER 17 SUMMARY - PART THREE

O'Brien enters Winston's cell. Winston realizes O'Brien has always been with the Thought Police, never part of the Brotherhood. "They got me a long time ago," Winston says.

O'Brien takes charge of Winston's torture and "re-education." The torture is systematic and brutal, involving beatings, electroshock, and starvation.

O'Brien reveals:
- The Brotherhood may or may not exist - Winston will never know
- Goldstein's book was written by the Inner Party (possibly including O'Brien himself)
- O'Brien has been watching Winston for seven years
- The place where there is no darkness" is the Ministry of Love (always lit)

O'Brien's goal is not to extract a confession or punish, but to CURE Winston - to make him genuinely love Big Brother.

O'Brien tortures Winston while teaching him the Party's philosophy:
- "Freedom is slavery" - freedom is the freedom to say 2+2=4, but the Party can make it 5
- Reality exists only in the mind; the Party controls reality
- The Party seeks power purely for its own sake: "The object of power is power"
- "If you want a picture of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human faceâ€”forever"

Winston is broken down physically and mentally. When shown his reflection, he's shocked by how skeletal and aged he's become.
