CHAPTER 3 SUMMARY - PART ONE

Winston wakes from a dream about his mother and younger sister, who disappeared in one of the purges when he was 10 or 11. In the dream, they are sinking beneath him in dark water, sacrificing themselves so he could live. He realizes that genuine tragedy and love existed in the past but are no longer possible in the present - "Today there were fear, hatred, and pain, but no dignity of emotion, no deep or complex sorrows."

His dream shifts to the "Golden Country" - a peaceful pastoral landscape he often dreams of. The dark-haired girl from his workplace appears and tears off her clothes in a gesture of defiance that seems to "annihilate a whole culture." Winston wakes with the word "Shakespeare" on his lips.

He participates in the mandatory "Physical Jerks" (morning exercises broadcast via telescreen). During the exercise, he reflects on:

Memory and History: Winston struggles to remember his childhood. The Party constantly rewrites history, erasing and altering the past. Even the names of countries have changed (England is now "Airstrip One").

Perpetual War: Winston can't remember a time of peace. The war alliances keep shifting - four years ago Oceania was allied with Eurasia and fighting Eastasia, but now it's reversed. The Party claims the current alliance has always existed.

Doublethink: The Party slogan states "Who controls the past controls the future: who controls the present controls the past." Winston contemplates the terrifying concept of "doublethink" - simultaneously believing contradictory things while being unconscious that you're doing so. Reality itself is controlled by the Party.

The telescreen instructor singles out Winston for not bending properly, demonstrating the constant surveillance and control over even the smallest physical actions.
