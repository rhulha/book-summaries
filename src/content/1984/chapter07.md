CHAPTER 7 SUMMARY - PART ONE

Winston writes in his diary: "If there is hope, it lies in the proles."

The Proles (Proletariat):
- Make up 85% of Oceania's population
- Live in relative freedom - most don't even have telescreens
- The Party views them as "natural inferiors" who must be kept subjugated "like animals"
- Party slogan: "Proles and animals are free"
- They're allowed sexual freedom, gambling, and even religious worship if desired
- "Until they become conscious they will never rebel, and until after they have rebelled they cannot become conscious"
- Winston believes they could overthrow the Party if they realized their strength, but they only care about petty grievances (like saucepans), not larger issues

Impossibility of Knowing the Past:
Winston realizes life before the Revolution cannot be verified. Party history books claim the past was terrible oppression, but there's no way to prove or disprove it. He reads a children's textbook describing evil "capitalists" in ridiculous terms.

The Photograph - Concrete Proof of Falsification:
Years ago (1973), Winston briefly possessed undeniable proof of the Party's lies: a photograph showing three purged Party members (Jones, Aaronson, and Rutherford) at a Party function in New York on a date when they had confessed to being in Siberia betraying secrets to Eurasia. The photograph proved their confessions were lies.

Winston destroyed the photograph in a memory hole after 30 seconds. He reflects that even if it still existed, it might now be meaningless since alliances have shifted.

He writes: "Freedom is the freedom to say that two plus two make four. If that is granted, all else follows."
