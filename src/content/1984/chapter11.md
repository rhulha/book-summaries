Winston and Julia meet rarely - once more for sex (in a church belfry), but mostly brief encounters in crowded streets, conducting fragmented conversations she calls "talking by instalments."

Julia's Background:
- 26 years old, lives in a hostel, works on novel-writing machines in Fiction Department
- Has no memories before the early 1960s; no interest in Party doctrine or the past
- Was a model Party youth: Spies troop-leader, Youth League secretary, Junior Anti-Sex League member
- Worked in "Pornosec" producing pornography for proles
- Had her first affair at 16; has had many since

Julia's Philosophy:
She's not interested in overthrowing the Party - she thinks organized revolt is stupid and doomed to fail. Her rebellion is personal: break rules, enjoy life, avoid getting caught. She refuses to believe the Brotherhood exists.

Julia understands the Party's sexual puritanism: "When you make love you're using up energy; and afterwards you feel happy and don't give a damn for anything... All this marching up and down and cheering and waving flags is simply sex gone sour."

Winston tells Julia about almost pushing his wife Katharine off a cliff years ago. Julia says she would have done it. Winston reflects: "We are the dead." Julia: "We're not dead yet."
