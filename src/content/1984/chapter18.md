CHAPTER 18 SUMMARY - PART THREE

Winston's torture continues. O'Brien uses a dial that controls the intensity of electric shocks.

O'Brien forces Winston to accept that 2+2=5, sometimes 3, sometimes all of them simultaneously - whatever the Party says. Winston tries to believe it to stop the pain.

O'Brien shows Winston photographs (including the one of Jones, Aaronson, and Rutherford that Winston saw years ago), then makes them disappear down the memory hole. "They never existed," O'Brien says, forcing Winston to accept that his memory is false.

Winston's mind begins to crack. He starts to genuinely believe the Party's version of reality, using doublethink to simultaneously know and not know the truth.

O'Brien reveals the three stages of Winston's reintegration:
1. LEARNING (understanding)
2. UNDERSTANDING (acceptance)
3. ACCEPTANCE (loving Big Brother)

Winston is currently between stages 2 and 3. He has accepted the Party's power intellectually but doesn't yet love Big Brother emotionally.

O'Brien asks what Winston's last refuge is - what keeps him from fully submitting. Winston cries out "Julia!" - he still loves her.

O'Brien says Winston will need to go to Room 101.
