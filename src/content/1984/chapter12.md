Winston rents the room above Mr. Charrington's junk shop as a secret hideaway for himself and Julia. The room has no telescreen, making it seem like a sanctuary from the Party's surveillance.

Mr. Charrington teaches Winston more of the "Oranges and Lemons" nursery rhyme. Winston buys the glass paperweight with coral inside - a beautiful, useless object from the past.

Julia brings real coffee, sugar, bread, and jam from the black market. They enjoy these luxuries and make love in the room. Winston feels they have created a private world.

Julia puts on makeup, making herself look more feminine and beautiful. This simple act of vanity is itself rebellious.

They discuss their inevitable capture and death, but Julia remains more optimistic about evading the Thought Police than Winston.
