CHAPTER 6 SUMMARY - PART ONE

Winston writes in his diary about a sexual encounter with a prostitute three years ago. The Party's attitude toward sex is explained:

The Party and Sex:
- The Party aims to remove ALL pleasure from the sexual act
- Marriage between Party members requires committee approval; permission is refused if the couple appears physically attracted
- The only recognized purpose of marriage is to produce children for the Party
- Sex is to be viewed as "a slightly disgusting minor operation, like having an enema"
- The Junior Anti-Sex League advocates complete celibacy
- The Party tolerates prostitution among proles as an outlet for instincts, as long as it's "furtive and joyless"
- "The sexual act, successfully performed, was rebellion. Desire was thoughtcrime."

Winston's Marriage to Katharine:
- They separated 9-11 years ago after only 15 months together
- Katharine was rigidly orthodox - "not a thought in her head that was not a slogan"
- She was frigid and unresponsive, but insisted on regular intercourse for "our duty to the Party" to try to produce a child
- The Party does not permit divorce but encourages separation when there are no children

Winston finishes writing about the prostitute - she turned out to be old (at least 50), with thick paint on her face and no teeth. Despite being horrified, he went through with it. The writing doesn't provide the catharsis he hoped for.
