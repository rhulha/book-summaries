CHAPTER 19 SUMMARY - PART THREE

Winston is held in better conditions, allowed to recover somewhat. He's given food, allowed to wash, and can move around his cell.

He gains back some weight and strength. He even has dreams of Julia and the Golden Country.

Winston writes "2+2=5" and "GOD IS POWER" on his slate, trying to convince himself. He's intellectually broken but still holds onto his love for Julia emotionally.

In his mind, Winston still confesses secretly to thoughtcrimes he doesn't actually feel guilty about. He has learned to lie to the Party but not yet to lie to himself completely.

Winston understands he will be released, allowed to live for a while, and then eventually taken out and shot. He knows too much to be allowed to exist indefinitely.

One night Winston dreams of Julia and cries out her name. He knows this means he's not fully cured.

Guards come for him. He's going to Room 101 - the place where "the worst thing in the world" awaits.
