CHAPTER 10 SUMMARY - PART TWO

Winston meets the girl (Julia) in the Golden Country - the pastoral landscape from his dreams. She leads him to a hidden clearing in the woods.

Julia reveals she's had many affairs with Party members. Winston is thrilled by this corruption: "The more men you've had, the more I love you... I hate purity, I hate goodness!" Their sexual relationship is an act of rebellion against the Party.

Julia explains her strategy for survival: enthusiastically participate in Party activities (Junior Anti-Sex League, Hate Week preparations, etc.) as camouflage, so you can break the big rules. "If you kept the small rules, you could break the big ones."

They make love. Winston realizes "Their embrace had been a battle, the climax a victory. It was a blow struck against the Party. It was a political act."
