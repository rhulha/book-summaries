CHAPTER 1 SUMMARY - PART ONE

Winston Smith, a 39-year-old Party member, returns home to his flat in Victory Mansions in London (now Airstrip One, part of Oceania). The dystopian world is dominated by Big Brother and the Party, with omnipresent telescreens that monitor citizens constantly. Winston observes the three Party slogans: "WAR IS PEACE, FREEDOM IS SLAVERY, IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH."

In his flat, Winston takes advantage of a blind spot from the telescreen and begins writing in a diary - an act of rebellion that could result in death or 25 years in a forced-labour camp. He writes about a war film showing the brutal killing of refugees, revealing the Party's desensitization to violence.

At the Ministry of Truth (where Winston works), he attends the Two Minutes Hate, a daily ritual where Party members direct rage at Emmanuel Goldstein, the Party's enemy. During the Hate, Winston notices:
- A dark-haired girl from the Fiction Department who makes him uneasy
- O'Brien, an Inner Party member whom Winston suspects may be secretly against the Party

During an intense moment of the Hate, Winston believes he and O'Brien exchange a meaningful look of mutual understanding and rebellion.

Back home, Winston writes "DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER" repeatedly in his diary, realizing he has committed "thoughtcrime" - the ultimate crime against the Party. He knows the Thought Police will eventually catch him. A knock at his door fills him with terror.
