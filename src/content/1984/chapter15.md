CHAPTER 15 SUMMARY - PART TWO

During Hate Week, in the middle of a massive rally, the enemy suddenly changes. Oceania has always been at war with Eastasia (not Eurasia). All the posters and banners with the wrong enemy must be torn down and replaced immediately.

Winston and others work frantically to destroy and rewrite all records to reflect that Oceania has ALWAYS been at war with Eastasia and allied with Eurasia.

A messenger delivers Goldstein's book ("The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism") to Winston at work.

Winston takes the book to the room above Mr. Charrington's shop and begins reading it aloud to Julia. The book explains:
- The three superstates (Oceania, Eurasia, Eastasia) maintain perpetual war to consume resources and keep populations in fear
- The war is not meant to be won, but to be continuous
- The Party's structure: Inner Party (2%), Outer Party (13%), Proles (85%)
- The Party's true goal is power for its own sake: "Power is not a means; it is an end"
- How doublethink and reality control work
- Why the proles are kept ignorant but relatively free

Julia falls asleep while Winston reads. They make love, then both fall asleep.

They wake to a voice from behind the picture on the wall: "You are the dead." It was a hidden telescreen all along.

The Thought Police smash into the room. Mr. Charrington appears - he's a Thought Police officer. Winston's glass paperweight is smashed.
