CHAPTER 22 SUMMARY - PART THREE

Winston continues his empty existence at the Chestnut Tree Cafe. He drinks gin, plays chess against himself, and watches the telescreen.

He works on a problem: how to make a chess problem where it looks like white will win but black actually wins. This occupies his mind and gives him a strange satisfaction.

Winston has become everything the Party wanted: obedient, mentally controlled, broken.

He no longer wonders about the past or questions the Party. He accepts doublethink fully. When Oceania changes enemies again, he accepts it without difficulty.

Winston vaguely remembers his mother, Julia, and the glass paperweight, but these memories are distant and don't trouble him.

He waits, knowing that eventually he will be taken out and shot - "the bullet entering his brain" - but he no longer fears it. In fact, he vaguely looks forward to it.
