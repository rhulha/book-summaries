O'Brien contacts Winston at work, inviting him to his apartment under the pretext of lending him the new Newspeak dictionary.

Winston and Julia visit O'Brien's luxurious Inner Party apartment. O'Brien reveals he is part of the Brotherhood (the underground resistance led by Goldstein) and that he has been watching Winston for years.

O'Brien administers an oath to Winston and Julia, asking if they're willing to:
- Commit murder, sabotage, treason
- Distribute addictive drugs, spread venereal diseases
- Throw acid in a child's face
- Give up their own lives

They agree to everything except being separated forever.

O'Brien promises to send Winston a copy of Goldstein's book, which explains the true nature of their society. He teaches them a toast: "To the past."

O'Brien warns them they will eventually be captured and executed, but says: "We shall meet in the place where there is no darkness."
