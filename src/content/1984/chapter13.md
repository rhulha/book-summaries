CHAPTER 13 SUMMARY - PART TWO

Winston and Julia continue meeting in the room above the shop. They discuss the Party's control and their limited rebellion.

Winston reads to Julia from a children's history book. They talk about the proles and whether there's any hope for the future.

Syme has disappeared (vaporized), just as Winston predicted. Nobody mentions it; his name simply vanishes from records.

Preparations for Hate Week intensify. The city is filled with posters, marching, and patriotic fervor.

Winston discusses with Julia whether they should separate to be safer, but neither wants to. They know their affair will end in capture, torture, and death, but they continue anyway.
