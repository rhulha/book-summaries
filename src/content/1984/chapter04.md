This chapter provides a detailed look at Winston's job at the Ministry of Truth. He works in the Records Department, rewriting and falsifying historical records to align with the Party's current narrative.

Winston's Daily Work:
- He receives messages via pneumatic tubes instructing him to "rectify" (alter) past newspaper articles
- Examples of alterations: changing Big Brother's predictions to match what actually happened, adjusting economic forecasts to hide failures, rewriting promises (like the chocolate ration pledge)
- Original documents are destroyed in "memory holes" - chutes leading to furnaces
- The corrected versions replace the originals completely, erasing all evidence of changes

The Scale of Falsification:
The Ministry systematically alters ALL historical records - newspapers, books, photographs, films, even works of art and poetry. "All history was a palimpsest, scraped clean and reinscribed exactly as often as was necessary."

Winston's coworkers include:
- A woman who deletes names of "vaporized" people (her own husband was vaporized)
- Ampleforth: a poet who rewrites "ideologically offensive" poems
- Tillotson: likely working on competing versions of the same historical revision

The Major Task:
Winston must rewrite an article praising "Comrade Withers" who has been vaporized (become an "unperson"). Winston invents a fictional hero, "Comrade Ogilvy" - a perfect Party member who never existed. He creates an entire biography for this imaginary person, complete with a heroic death.

Winston reflects: "Comrade Ogilvy, who had never existed in the present, now existed in the past" - as real as any historical figure once the forgery is complete. Statistics and facts are pure fantasy; truth becomes whatever the Party says it is.
