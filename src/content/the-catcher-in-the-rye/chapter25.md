Outside at dawn, Holden walked to Grand Central Station and slept on a bench in the waiting room until nine o'clock when crowds forced him to sit up. He felt more depressed than ever and obsessively reconsidered the incident with Mr. Antolini, wondering if he had misinterpreted the gesture and should have stayed. This uncertainty deepened his depression. He read a magazine article about hormones that made him worry he looked unhealthy, and another about cancer that convinced him a sore in his mouth meant he was dying. Feeling sick, he went for a walk and bought doughnuts and coffee but couldn't swallow the food. On Fifth Avenue near Christmas, he looked for the two nuns but didn't see them. He thought about shopping with Phoebe the previous Christmas. Suddenly, walking became terrifying--every time he stepped off a curb, he felt he would disappear and never reach the other side. He began praying to Allie at each corner: "Allie, don't let me disappear." Finally reaching the Sixties past the zoo, he sat on a bench and decided to leave New York permanently, hitchhike west, get a job at a gas station, and pretend to be a deaf-mute to avoid conversations. He would build a cabin and possibly marry a deaf-mute woman. Excited by this plan, he wanted to say goodbye to Phoebe first. He bought paper and wrote her a note to meet him at the Museum of Art at 12:15 to return her Christmas money. At Phoebe's school, which he had attended as a child, he saw "Fuck you" written on the wall. Enraged, imagining how it would affect young children, he rubbed it off. He delivered the note through the principal's office, then found another obscenity scratched into a wall, realizing it was hopeless to erase them all. At the museum, he helped two young boys find the mummies, but they fled when frightened. Even in the tomb, he found another "Fuck you" written in red crayon, concluding there was no peaceful place anywhere. After briefly passing out in the bathroom, he waited for Phoebe outside. When she arrived wearing his red hunting hat and dragging a suitcase, she announced she was coming with him. Holden was devastated, almost ready to hit her. She cried, and he cruelly reminded her about her play. He took her suitcase to check it and told her he had changed his mind about leaving, but she turned her back on him angrily and refused to return to school. They walked separately to the zoo, Phoebe on one side of the street refusing to look at him. At the zoo, she gradually softened as they watched the sea lions and bears. At the carousel, Holden bought her a ticket. She gave him back his money, saying "please" in a way that depressed him. As she rode the carousel in the rain, reaching for the gold ring, Holden sat on a bench getting soaked, wearing his hunting hat that she had returned to him. Watching Phoebe go around and around in her blue coat, he felt so happy he nearly cried, though he didn't know why.
