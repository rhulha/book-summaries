Holden arrived at Penn Station in New York and went into a phone booth, wanting to call someone but unable to think of anyone appropriate. He considered calling his younger sister Phoebe, Jane Gallagher's mother, Sally Hayes, or Carl Luce, but found reasons not to call any of them. After twenty minutes, he gave up and took a cab. Out of habit, he initially gave his home address but then remembered his plan to stay at a hotel. He asked the cab driver about the ducks in Central Park's lagoon, but the driver thought he was crazy. Holden checked into the Edmont Hotel, removing his distinctive red hunting hat first so he wouldn't look like a "screwball." From his crumby room, he watched bizarre activities in the windows across from him: a man dressing in women's clothing and a couple squirting water at each other's faces. These observations both fascinated and disgusted him, leading to reflections about his confused feelings toward sex and girls. Feeling horny and bored, he found an address for Faith Cavendish, a woman he had been told would "not mind doing it once in a while." He called her late at night, claiming to be a friend of Eddie Birdsell from Princeton. Though initially angry at being woken up, she became friendlier but ultimately declined his invitation for drinks, saying her roommate was ill. Holden realized he had fouled up the conversation.
