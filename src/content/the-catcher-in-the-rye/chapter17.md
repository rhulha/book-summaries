Holden arrived early at the Biltmore Hotel to meet Sally Hayes. While watching girls waiting for their dates, he reflected philosophically on how most would probably marry "dopey guys" who talk about cars and are boring. He thought about his former roommate Harris Macklin, who was a terrible bore but an excellent whistler, leading him to conclude he didn't understand boring people. When Sally arrived looking "terrific" in a black coat and beret, Holden impulsively felt like marrying her despite not even liking her much. They took a cab to see the Lunts perform in "I Know My Love." During the ride, they kissed, and Holden told her he loved her, which was a lie though he meant it when he said it. The play bored Holden, who found the Lunts too polished and show-offy. At intermission, they encountered phonies smoking and discussing the play pretentiously. Sally recognized an Andover student named George, and their fake, enthusiastic greeting disgusted Holden. George had a phony Ivy League voice and discussed the play as though the Lunts were "angels." After the show, Sally suggested ice-skating at Radio City. They were terrible skaters, with Sally's ankles bending painfully. Inside for drinks, Holden suddenly poured out his feelings about hating school and New York's phoniness. He impulsively proposed they run away to Massachusetts and Vermont, get married, and live in a cabin. Sally thought it was a ridiculous, immature idea. Their argument escalated until Holden called her a "pain in the ass," making her cry. He apologized but then laughed at the situation, angering her further. He left alone, later admitting he probably wouldn't have taken her anyway but meant it when he asked.
