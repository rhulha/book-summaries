Mr. and Mrs. Antolini lived in a swanky Sutton Place apartment. Mr. Antolini, whom Holden considered the best teacher he'd ever had, was young, witty, and had been the one who picked up James Castle's body after his suicide, covering him with his own coat without caring about the blood. Mrs. Antolini was much older and wealthy. Feeling dizzy when he left home, Holden took a cab to their apartment. Mr. Antolini, already somewhat drunk in his bathrobe with a highball, greeted him warmly with his characteristic witty remarks. The apartment showed signs of a recent party. Over coffee, Holden explained he had passed English but flunked Oral Expression because he disliked when students yelled "Digression!" at speakers who wandered from their topics. He preferred the digressions, especially from a nervous boy named Richard Kinsella whose personal stories were more interesting than his assigned topics. Mr. Antolini, getting progressively more intoxicated, delivered a serious lecture warning that Holden was "riding for some kind of terrible, terrible fall" where he would keep falling without ever hitting bottom. He wrote down a quote from psychoanalyst Wilhelm Stekel: "The mark of the immature man is that he wants to die nobly for a cause, while the mark of the mature man is that he wants to live humbly for one." He encouraged Holden to apply himself in school and discover his intellectual capacity, explaining that educated men leave more valuable records behind. Exhausted, Holden could barely stay awake. They made up the couch and Holden went to sleep. Later, he woke to find Mr. Antolini sitting on the floor in the dark, petting his head. Terrified and embarrassed, thinking it was a sexual advance, Holden hastily dressed and left despite Mr. Antolini's protests, shaking and sweating as he fled into the night.
