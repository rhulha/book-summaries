On Saturday night, Pencey served its weekly steak dinner, which Holden described as a sham designed to impress visiting parents despite the poor quality of the food. After dinner, it was snowing heavily, and Holden, along with his friend Mal Brossard and reluctantly Ackley, went into town to get hamburgers and possibly see a movie. However, Brossard and Ackley had already seen the film playing, so they just ate and played pinball before returning to the dorm. Back at Pencey, Ackley invaded Holden's room again and lay on his bed, talking monotonously about an alleged sexual encounter that Holden knew was fabricated. Eventually, Holden told Ackley he needed to write the composition for Stradlater. Once alone, Holden put on his pajamas, bathrobe, and red hunting hat and began writing. Unable to think of a room or house to describe as Stradlater requested, he instead wrote about his deceased younger brother Allie's baseball mitt. Allie, who had been left-handed, had written poems in green ink all over his glove so he would have something to read when no one was at bat. Allie had died of leukemia on July 18, 1946, at age eleven. He had been highly intelligent, kind, and red-haired. When Allie died, thirteen-year-old Holden broke all the windows in the garage with his fist in grief, breaking his hand in the process. Holden spent about an hour writing this deeply personal composition about his brother's mitt.
