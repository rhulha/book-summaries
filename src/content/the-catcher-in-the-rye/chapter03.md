Holden revealed his tendency to lie compulsively, admitting he hadn't actually needed to go to the gym at all. He returned to his room in the Ossenburger Memorial Wing, named after a wealthy Pencey alumnus who made his fortune in the undertaking business and whom Holden viewed as a phony. Alone in his room, Holden put on his distinctive red hunting hat, which he had bought in New York that morning, and began reading "Out of Africa" by Isak Dinesen. He shared his thoughts about reading, explaining that his favorite books were ones that made him wish the author was a friend he could call. His roommate's neighbor, Robert Ackley, soon interrupted him. Ackley was a senior with terrible personal hygiene, including mossy teeth, pimples, and generally unpleasant habits. He barged into Holden's room uninvited, as he often did, and began his usual routine of picking up Holden's personal belongings and asking annoying questions. Their interaction was interrupted when Holden's roommate, Ward Stradlater, returned from the football game in a hurry. Stradlater, a handsome and athletic student whom Holden described as a "secret slob," asked to borrow Holden's hound's-tooth jacket for a date. Ackley quickly left when Stradlater arrived, as the two disliked each other, and Stradlater went to shave before his date.
