Holden followed Stradlater to the bathroom while his roommate shaved and prepared for his date. In the hot, steamy bathroom, Holden sat on a washbowl and observed Stradlater's grooming ritual. Despite always looking presentable, Stradlater was a "secret slob" who used a rusty, dirty razor but was vain and obsessed with his appearance. Stradlater asked Holden to write a descriptive composition for his English class, as he had a hundred pages of history reading to do. Holden, ironically the one flunking out, agreed to consider it. The conversation took a dramatic turn when Stradlater revealed that his date was Jean Gallagher. Holden became extremely excited and agitated, as he knew Jane (not Jean) well from two summers ago when they lived near each other. He enthusiastically told Stradlater about Jane: how she played checkers and kept all her kings in the back row, how she practiced ballet for two hours daily, and how she had a difficult childhood with a divorced mother married to an alcoholic who ran around the house naked. Stradlater showed little interest except in the sexual implications. Holden kept saying he should go down to say hello to Jane but never did, claiming he wasn't in the mood. Before leaving, Holden asked Stradlater not to tell Jane he'd been kicked out and to ask her about the checkers, which Stradlater agreed to but probably wouldn't remember.
