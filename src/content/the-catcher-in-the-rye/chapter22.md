When Phoebe finally removed the pillow from her head, she remained angry, turning away and ostracizing Holden just as the fencing team had done when he lost the equipment. When he tried to discuss it, she kept insisting "Daddy's gonna kill you." Holden explained he might go work on a ranch in Colorado, but Phoebe called him out, saying he couldn't even ride a horse. She acted like a schoolteacher, asking if he had failed every subject, and was hurt when she asked "why did you do it?" Holden tried to explain that Pencey was full of phonies and mean guys who excluded people like Robert Ackley from their secret fraternities. He described how even good teachers like Mr. Spencer became phonies when Headmaster Thurmer visited, and recounted a depressing Veterans' Day story about an old alumnus searching for his initials in a bathroom stall door. When Phoebe said "You don't like anything that's happening," it depressed Holden further. She challenged him to name one thing he liked. Struggling to concentrate, he could only think of the two nuns and James Castle, a boy at Elkton Hills who jumped out a window rather than take back something he said about a conceited student. Castle had been wearing Holden's turtleneck sweater when he died. When Phoebe pressed him, Holden said he liked Allie and sitting with her right then. Phoebe rejected Allie as an answer because he was dead. When she asked what he wanted to be, Holden revealed his fantasy of being "the catcher in the rye"--standing at the edge of a cliff in a field where children play, catching them before they fall off. He misquoted the Robert Burns poem, but explained he wanted to save children from danger. Afterward, he called his former English teacher Mr. Antolini, who invited him over immediately.
