After Sunny left, Holden felt miserable and depressed. He began talking out loud to his dead brother Allie, something he did when very depressed. He remembered a time when he had refused to let Allie join him and Bobby Fallon on a bike trip, and he still felt guilty about it. He got into bed and tried to pray but couldn't, describing himself as "sort of an atheist." He liked Jesus but disliked most of the Bible, especially the Disciples, whom he felt constantly let Jesus down. He discussed his religious views, including his belief that Jesus wouldn't have sent Judas to Hell. He explained that his parents were different religions and all the children were atheists, and he couldn't stand ministers with their phony "Holy Joe voices." While lying in bed unable to pray, Sunny and Maurice knocked on his door again, demanding another five dollars. Maurice, a huge man in his elevator operator's uniform, forced his way into the room with Sunny. They argued about the price, with Maurice claiming he had said ten dollars. When Holden refused to pay, calling Maurice a moron, Maurice punched him hard in the stomach. While doubled over in pain, Sunny took five dollars from his wallet. After they left, Holden lay on the floor for a long time, then fantasized about being shot and seeking revenge on Maurice in a movie-style scenario where Jane would bandage his wounds. He recognized how movies had corrupted his thinking. Feeling suicidal, he took a bath and eventually got back into bed.
