Holden concluded his narrative by refusing to share what happened after he went home, how he got sick, or details about the school he was supposed to attend next fall. He explained that such information didn't interest him much. He was currently in some kind of rest facility where a psychoanalyst kept asking if he would apply himself when he returned to school in September, which Holden considered a stupid question because nobody knows what they'll do until they actually do it. His brother D.B. visited the previous Saturday with an affected but attractive English woman who was in his new movie. When she left the room, D.B. asked Holden what he thought about everything he had just recounted. Holden didn't know what to say or think about it all. His final reflection was surprising: he was sorry he had told so many people about his experiences because now he sort of missed everybody he had talked about, even Stradlater, Ackley, and Maurice. He concluded with a warning and observation that captured his entire predicament: "Don't ever tell anybody anything. If you do, you start missing everybody." This brief, enigmatic chapter brought Holden's story full circle, returning to the present moment in the facility where he began his narrative, leaving his future uncertain and his emotional state unresolved, though perhaps with a greater understanding of his connections to others and the complexity of human relationships.
