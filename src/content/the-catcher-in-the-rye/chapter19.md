At the Wicker Bar, described as a swanky, phony place with terrible entertainment by French singers Tina and Janine, Holden arrived early and had a couple of Scotch and sodas. When Carl Luce showed up, he immediately said he could only stay briefly as he had a date. Holden tried to engage him in conversation about sex and Luce's current girlfriend. Luce revealed he was dating a Chinese sculptress in her late thirties from Shanghai, explaining that he found Eastern philosophy more satisfactory than Western regarding sex as both physical and spiritual. Luce became increasingly irritated with Holden's persistent, personal questions, calling them "typical Caulfield questions" and asking when he would grow up. When Holden admitted his sex life was terrible because he could only get excited about girls he really liked, Luce suggested he see a psychoanalyst, specifically Luce's father who was one. Luce explained that analysis would help Holden "recognize the patterns of your mind." Throughout their conversation, Luce was condescending and dismissive, wanting to control the intellectual discussion. When Holden tried to ask if Luce's father had analyzed him, Luce said his father had helped him "adjust" but an extensive analysis hadn't been necessary. Despite Holden's plea that he was "lonesome as hell" and asking him to stay for another drink, Luce left. Holden recognized that Luce was "strictly a pain in the ass" but acknowledged he had an excellent vocabulary, the largest of any boy at Whooton.
