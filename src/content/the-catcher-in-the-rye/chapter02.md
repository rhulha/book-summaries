Holden visited his history teacher, Mr. Spencer, who was sick with the flu in his home off campus. The elderly teacher, around seventy years old, lived modestly with his wife. When Holden entered Spencer's bedroom, he immediately regretted coming, as the room smelled of Vicks Nose Drops and the sight of the sick, elderly man in his ratty bathrobe was depressing. Spencer attempted to lecture Holden about his poor academic performance and his expulsion from Pencey. He reminded Holden that Dr. Thurmer, the headmaster, had told him that "life is a game" that should be played by the rules. Holden privately disagreed, thinking it was only a game if you were on the winning side. Spencer then humiliated Holden by reading aloud his terrible essay exam about the Egyptians, including the apologetic note Holden had written at the end. While Spencer tried to make Holden understand the seriousness of being expelled from yet another school, Holden's mind wandered to thoughts about the ducks in Central Park's lagoon and where they went when the water froze. The visit became increasingly uncomfortable, and Holden eventually made excuses about needing to get equipment from the gym. They parted with a handshake, and Spencer likely called out "Good luck!" which Holden hated hearing.
