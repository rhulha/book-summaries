Holden Caulfield began his narrative from some rest facility where he had been recovering after a breakdown the previous December. He refused to share his entire life story, dismissing it as "David Copperfield kind of crap," and instead focused on the events leading to his collapse. He mentioned his brother D.B., a talented short story writer who had "sold out" by moving to Hollywood to write for movies, which Holden despised. The main action started on a Saturday afternoon at Pencey Prep, a prestigious boarding school in Pennsylvania, during the last football game of the year. Holden stood alone on Thomsen Hill instead of attending the game because he had just returned from New York where he had managed the fencing team and lost all their equipment on the subway. He had been expelled from Pencey for failing four subjects and not applying himself, making this his fourth school expulsion. On this cold December day, Holden was heading to say goodbye to his history teacher, Mr. Spencer, who had requested to see him before he left. Throughout the chapter, Holden's cynical voice emerged as he critiqued everything from Pencey's false advertising to the phoniness of its headmaster, establishing his deep alienation from the world around him.
