Not tired enough to sleep, Holden changed his shirt and went downstairs to the Lavender Room, the hotel's nightclub. He thought about calling his ten-year-old sister Phoebe, whom he described with deep affection as smart, pretty, skinny like him, and perceptive beyond her years. He recounted how Phoebe was straight-A student who wrote incomplete detective stories about a character named "Hazle Weatherfield" and knew movies by heart. In the Lavender Room, the band was terrible, and Holden was refused alcohol despite trying to order a Scotch and soda. Three women around thirty from Seattle sat at the next table. Though he found them mostly unattractive and unintelligent, Holden introduced himself as "Jim Steele" and asked them to dance. The blonde, Bernice, turned out to be an excellent dancer, and Holden admitted he fell "half in love with her" despite her stupidity. The three women spent the entire evening looking for movie stars and talking in clich\u00e9s. They told Holden about their plan to wake up early to see the first show at Radio City Music Hall, which deeply depressed him. After buying them drinks, they left. Holden paid the thirteen-dollar check and felt sorry for them with their "sad, fancy hats," finding it depressing that they came all the way from Seattle just to see a show at Radio City. He left the club soon after, feeling lonely and depressed.
