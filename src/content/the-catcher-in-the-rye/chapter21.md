Holden got an enormous break when he arrived home because the regular elevator operator Pete wasn't working. He told the new, somewhat dim-witted operator to take him to the Dicksteins' apartment on his floor, but when the operator said they were at a party, Holden claimed to be their nephew and invented a story about having a bad leg that needed to be in a certain position. Once the elevator left, he limped to his family's apartment and quietly let himself in with his key, thinking he should have been a crook. The foyer had a distinctive smell that made him know he was home. He carefully avoided the noisy hangers in the closet and crept past his parents' bedroom, knowing his father was a sound sleeper but his mother had hearing like a bloodhound and was nervous, staying up all night smoking. He found Phoebe sleeping in D.B.'s room instead of her own, as she preferred the larger space with the enormous desk and bed. She looked peaceful sleeping with her mouth open. Holden felt wonderful for a change as he looked at her neat clothes and examined her school notebooks, which were filled with notes to friends, homework questions, and signatures with her adopted middle name "Weatherfield" instead of Josephine. The notebooks delighted him. After reading them and smoking his last cigarette, he woke Phoebe. She immediately recognized him, was thrilled to see him, and affectionately hugged him. She excitedly told him about her play where she would be Benedict Arnold and asked if he would come. However, her excitement turned to alarm when she realized he was home early from school and deduced he had been expelled again, saying "Daddy'll kill you" and refusing to take the pillow off her head in anger and distress.
