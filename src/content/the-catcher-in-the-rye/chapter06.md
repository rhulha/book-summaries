Holden anxiously awaited Stradlater's return from his date with Jane, worrying intensely about what might have happened. When Stradlater finally came back around ten-thirty, he complained about the cold but didn't mention Jane at all. He thanked Holden for the jacket and then read the composition Holden had written. Stradlater became angry when he discovered it was about a baseball glove instead of a room or house as requested. He accused Holden of always doing things backwards and said it was no wonder he was flunking out. Holden angrily grabbed the composition and tore it up. The tension escalated as Holden began asking about the date. Stradlater revealed they had just sat in Ed Banky's car, the basketball coach's vehicle that Stradlater had borrowed. When Stradlater made suggestive comments and refused to say whether he had "given her the time," Holden tried to punch him in the face but missed, only grazing his head. Stradlater, much stronger than Holden, pinned him to the floor. Holden kept calling him a moron and making accusations about Jane, which further enraged Stradlater. Finally, Stradlater punched Holden hard, causing his nose to bleed profusely. After Stradlater left for the bathroom, Holden found his hunting hat and examined his bloody face in the mirror, thinking he looked tough despite being a self-described pacifist who had lost both fights he'd ever been in.
