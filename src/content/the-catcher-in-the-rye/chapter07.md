With blood covering his face, Holden went through the shower curtains into Ackley's room. Ackley was awake and startled by Holden's appearance. Holden asked to play Canasta, but Ackley refused because it was late and he had to attend Mass in the morning. Holden then asked if he could sleep in Ackley's roommate Ely's bed, as Ely had gone home for the weekend. Ackley was characteristically unhelpful, saying he couldn't give permission for someone to sleep in Ely's bed. Holden called him a "prince" sarcastically. Feeling intensely lonely and depressed, Holden lay on Ely's bed thinking obsessively about Jane and Stradlater together in Ed Banky's car. He knew Stradlater's seduction technique from having double-dated with him before. Eventually, Ackley fell asleep and began snoring. Holden briefly considered joining a monastery but dismissed the idea. After a tense exchange with Ackley about religion, Holden left the room. Alone in the quiet, depressing corridor, he suddenly decided to leave Pencey immediately rather than wait until Wednesday. He planned to get a cheap hotel room in New York and relax for a few days until his parents received the letter about his expulsion and had time to digest it. He returned to his room, packed his bags while Stradlater slept, and sold his typewriter to Frederick Woodruff for twenty dollars. Before leaving, he stood in the corridor, put on his red hunting hat, and yelled "Sleep tight, ya morons!" then left Pencey.
