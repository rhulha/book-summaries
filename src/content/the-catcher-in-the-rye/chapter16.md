After breakfast, Holden took a long walk, unable to stop thinking about the two nuns and their beat-up straw basket. He contrasted them with his mother, aunt, and Sally Hayes's mother, none of whom would do charity work without being well-dressed and receiving recognition. He admired the nuns' humility, which made him sad. Walking toward Broadway, he searched for a record store open on Sunday to buy "Little Shirley Beans," a rare record about a child ashamed to go outside because she lost her front teeth. He wanted to give it to his sister Phoebe, who often roller-skated in Central Park on Sundays. On the way, he saw a family leaving church, and their young son walking in the street singing "If a body catch a body coming through the rye" cheered him up. On Broadway, the Sunday movie crowds depressed him--all the people dressed up and eager to get to the theaters. He found the record for five dollars and tried calling Jane Gallagher, but her mother answered so he hung up. He bought two tickets to "I Know My Love" starring the Lunts, knowing Sally would love it despite his own dislike of theater and actors. He took a cab to Central Park to find Phoebe but she wasn't there. A young girl told him Phoebe might be at the Museum of Natural History. This triggered extensive nostalgic memories of his school trips to the museum with Miss Aigletinger, describing the exhibits in loving detail. He reflected on how the museum never changed, but visitors did--"you'd just be different, that's all." When he actually reached the museum, he suddenly decided not to go in and took a cab to meet Sally instead.
