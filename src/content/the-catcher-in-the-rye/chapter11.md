Sitting alone in the hotel lobby, Holden couldn't stop thinking about Jane Gallagher and Stradlater. He reminisced extensively about the summer he met Jane two years earlier when her Doberman pinscher relieved itself on his family's lawn. After his mother complained, Holden later saw Jane at the club and eventually won her over. They spent the summer playing tennis every morning and golf every afternoon, developing an intimate but non-physical relationship. Holden described Jane as "funny" rather than strictly beautiful, with a mouth that "went in about fifty directions" when she talked. She was intellectual, read good books and poetry, and was the only person outside his family to whom he showed Allie's baseball mitt. He recounted one significant afternoon when they were playing checkers on her porch and her stepfather came out asking for cigarettes. When Jane wouldn't respond to him, a tear fell on the checkerboard, and Holden sat next to her and kissed her all over her face except her mouth. He asked her if her stepfather, Mr. Cudahy, had ever tried anything with her, but she said no. Holden never found out what was wrong. He remembered holding hands with her at movies and described it as making him genuinely happy. Thinking about these memories while imagining her with Stradlater nearly drove him crazy, making him feel depressed and restless enough to leave the hotel.
