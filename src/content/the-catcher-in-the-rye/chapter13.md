Holden walked forty-one blocks back to his hotel in the freezing cold, wearing his red hunting hat with the earflaps down. As he walked, he reflected on his "yellowness"--his inability to confront people physically. He imagined what would happen if he confronted someone who stole his gloves at Pencey, concluding he would never actually punch the thief despite wanting to. This self-analysis depressed him further. Back at the hotel lobby, which smelled of dead cigars, the elevator operator Maurice propositioned him, offering to send a prostitute to his room for five dollars. Despite it being against his principles, Holden agreed in his depressed state. He went to his room and nervously prepared, brushing his teeth and changing his shirt. He revealed that he was still a virgin, despite several opportunities, because he always stopped when girls asked him to. He hoped this experience would give him practice for marriage. When the young prostitute named Sunny arrived, she seemed around his age and very nervous. She quickly removed her dress, but Holden felt depressed rather than sexy. He tried to make conversation, asking where she was from and about her life. Feeling peculiar and sad, especially when he hung up her dress in the closet, Holden told her he had recently had an operation and couldn't go through with it. He offered to pay her five dollars anyway, but she insisted it cost ten, which he refused. She left angrily, calling him a "crumb-bum."
