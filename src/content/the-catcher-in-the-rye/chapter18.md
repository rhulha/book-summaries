After leaving Sally, Holden went to a drugstore for a Swiss cheese sandwich and malted milk. He tried calling Jane Gallagher again but got no answer. With the whole evening free, he looked through his near-empty address book and called Carl Luce, an intellectual former student adviser from Whooton School who was three years older and now at Columbia. Luce had previously given sex talks to younger students, discussing perverts and homosexuals. Though Holden had once called him a "fat-assed phony," Luce agreed to meet him at ten o'clock at the Wicker Bar. To kill time, Holden went to see a movie at Radio City Music Hall, which he described as "probably the worst thing I could've done." He watched the Rockettes, a roller-skating comedian, and a Christmas show with angels and crucifixes that he found phony and un-religious. He thought Jesus would have preferred the kettle drummer, whom Holden and Allie used to watch. The movie itself was "putrid"--a sentimental war story about an amnesiac duke that disgusted him. A woman next to him cried throughout the phony film while ignoring her young son who needed to use the bathroom, proving to Holden that people who cry at movies are often "mean bastards at heart." Walking to the Wicker Bar afterward, he thought about war and how he hated the Army, referencing his brother D.B.'s service and his conflicted feelings about books like "A Farewell to Arms." He concluded that if there's another war, he'd volunteer to sit on the atomic bomb.
