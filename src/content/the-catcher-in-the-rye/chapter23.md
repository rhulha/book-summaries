Mr. Antolini was warm and welcoming on the phone, even joking about Holden flunking out of Pencey. Back in D.B.'s room, Holden found Phoebe listening to dance music on the radio. He taught her to dance when she was little, and she had become excellent. They danced together for four numbers, with Phoebe seriously maintaining position between songs and staying perfectly in rhythm despite their height difference. After dancing, Phoebe playfully demonstrated how she could make her forehead hot by crossing her legs, holding her breath, and thinking of something hot. She was learning belching from a friend. Suddenly, they heard the front door open. Holden quickly turned off the light, stubbed out his cigarette, and hid in the closet as his parents came home from their party in Connecticut. His mother entered to check on Phoebe, who was awake. When Mrs. Caulfield smelled cigarette smoke, Phoebe claimed she had lit one briefly and thrown it out the window. After some conversation about the movie Phoebe had seen and dinner, Mrs. Caulfield finally left with a headache. Holden emerged from the closet, bumping into Phoebe in the dark. He told her he needed to leave and asked to borrow money. Though it was her Christmas shopping money, Phoebe insisted he take all $8.65. As she counted it out in the dark, Holden suddenly started crying uncontrollably, scaring Phoebe. She tried to comfort him, but he couldn't stop for a long time. When he finally composed himself, he gave Phoebe his red hunting hat, which she loved. He promised to call her and said Mr. Antolini was waiting. Leaving the apartment was easier than entering, and he almost didn't care if his parents caught him anymore.
