Holden took a cab to Ernie's, a Greenwich Village nightclub his brother D.B. used to frequent. The cab driver, Horwitz, was more talkative than the previous driver. Holden again asked about the ducks in Central Park's lagoon, but Horwitz became irritated and instead insisted on talking about the fish, arguing that they stayed frozen in the ice all winter with their pores open, taking in nutrition through the seaweed. The conversation grew heated, with Horwitz becoming increasingly touchy and excited, nearly crashing the cab. When Holden invited him for a drink, Horwitz asked why he wasn't home in bed at his age. At Ernie's, the club was jampacked with prep school and college students. Ernie, described as a fat Black piano player and terrible snob, was performing when Holden arrived. Though Ernie was technically skilled, Holden found his playing phony and show-offy, full of unnecessary flourishes. The crowd gave him a standing ovation, which disgusted Holden, who felt people always applauded for the wrong reasons. Seated at a terrible table behind a post, Holden ordered a Scotch and soda and observed the jerks around him. Suddenly, Lillian Simmons, an ex-girlfriend of D.B.'s, appeared with a Navy officer. She was pushy and phony, mainly interested in D.B.'s Hollywood career. To escape sitting with them, Holden claimed he had to meet somebody and left, angry that people were always ruining things for him.
