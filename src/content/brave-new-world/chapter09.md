After their disturbing day at the pueblo, Lenina takes a large dose of soma and falls into an 18-hour sleep. Bernard stays awake formulating a plan.

The next morning, Bernard flies to Santa Fe and contacts Mustapha Mond directly. The World Controller grants permission to bring John and Linda back to London, recognizing their scientific interest. Bernard obtains all necessary permits and returns to Malpais, feeling triumphant and important from his contact with high authority.

Meanwhile, John comes to the rest-house looking for Bernard and Lenina but finds the door locked. Thinking they've abandoned him, he's devastated and cries. Eventually he looks through the window and sees Lenina's suitcase, filling him with joy.

John breaks into the room and goes through Lenina's belongings with reverent fascination - her clothes, perfume, and powder. He's enchanted by the zippers and fabric, experiencing everything as precious relics of the woman he's falling in love with.

He discovers Lenina asleep in the next room. Kneeling beside her bed, John quotes Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, torn between his desire and his idealized notion of "pure and vestal modesty." Just as he contemplates unzipping her clothes, he hears Bernard's helicopter returning and rushes out to meet him.
