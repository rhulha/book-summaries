The tour continues to the Infant Nurseries and Neo-Pavlovian Conditioning Rooms. The Director demonstrates a conditioning experiment on Delta-caste babies. The infants are placed near books and flowers, then subjected to loud alarms and electric shocks when they approach them. After repeated exposures, the babies develop a conditioned aversion to books and nature.

The Director explains this is done for economic reasons - lower castes must not waste time reading or enjoying free natural pleasures, but they must still consume transport and manufactured goods for country sports.

The concept of "hypnopaedia" (sleep-teaching) is introduced through the story of Little Reuben, who accidentally absorbed a radio broadcast while sleeping. Though early experiments failed to use it for intellectual education, hypnopaedia proved effective for moral conditioning and instilling social values.

The chapter reveals that in this society, concepts like "mother," "father," and "parent" are considered obscene, and families have been abolished. The conditioning system ensures people accept their predetermined roles and consume products to maintain economic stability.
