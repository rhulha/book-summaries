The Director of Hatcheries and Conditioning leads a group of new students on a tour of the Central London Hatchery and Conditioning Centre. The facility operates under the World State's motto: "Community, Identity, Stability."

The tour demonstrates the advanced reproductive technology of this dystopian future society. The Director and Mr. Foster explain the Bokanovsky Process, which allows one fertilized egg to divide into up to 96 identical embryos, creating standardized batches of human beings. This mass production of humans is considered essential for social stability.

The students observe the various stages: the Fertilizing Room, the Bottling Room, and the Embryo Store. Embryos are classified into castes (Alphas, Betas, Gammas, Deltas, and Epsilons) and are conditioned during their development for specific roles in society. Lower castes receive oxygen deprivation to limit their intelligence and physical development.

The tour reveals a society that has completely industrialized human reproduction, predestining individuals from conception to fulfill predetermined social roles. Lenina Crowne, an attractive worker, is briefly introduced as she inoculates embryos.
