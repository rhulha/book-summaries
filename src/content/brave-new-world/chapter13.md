Lenina, consumed by her feelings for John, seeks advice from Fanny. Her friend is alarmed that Lenina has been fixated on one man for months, which is dangerously abnormal behavior. Fanny urges her to either seduce John immediately or take soma and be with other men.

Lenina decides to pursue John directly. She goes to his apartment and confesses her attraction to him. John is overjoyed, interpreting her words through his Shakespearean ideals of romantic love. He speaks passionately of devotion and doing deeds to prove himself worthy of her.

But when John talks of marriage and lifetime commitment, Lenina doesn't understand. In her world, such concepts don't exist. Frustrated by his flowery speech, she simply begins undressing, expecting casual sex as normal.

John is horrified by what he sees as Lenina's promiscuity and lack of virtue. His romantic idealization shatters. In a rage, calling her "whore" and "impudent strumpet," he violently drives her away. Lenina locks herself in the bathroom, terrified and confused.

At that moment, John receives a phone call that Linda is dying. He rushes to the hospital, leaving Lenina behind, their mutual incomprehension complete.
