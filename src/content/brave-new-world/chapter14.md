John rushes to Park Lane Hospital for the Dying where Linda lies in a coma from soma overdose. The hospital is designed to condition children to accept death cheerfully - it's filled with toys, television, and chocolate éclairs to make dying pleasant and eliminate any fear.

John is appalled to find groups of identical Delta children running around Linda's bed as part of their death-conditioning exercises. They've been brought to watch people die so they'll view death as normal and unimportant.

John sits by Linda's bedside, trying to connect with her, calling her "Mother" - a word that makes the Delta children giggle with embarrassment. Linda, deep in soma-induced hallucination, briefly surfaces to consciousness but confuses John with Popé and others from her past.

John desperately tries to reach her, to have one genuine moment with his mother, but she slips away. As she dies, John weeps - genuine grief that the children find bizarre and the nurse views as morbid.

The casual, efficient attitude toward death and the children's conditioning to see it as insignificant fills John with rage and despair. His mother's lonely, meaningless death in this sterile environment epitomizes everything he hates about civilization.
