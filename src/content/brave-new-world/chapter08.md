John (the Savage) tells Bernard his life story. He describes his difficult childhood in Malpais, where he was ostracized as an outsider. His mother Linda couldn't adapt to pueblo life - she was promiscuous according to her World State conditioning, which violated pueblo marriage customs and made her hated by the women.

John recounts painful memories: men visiting Linda, her drinking mescal (which she called soma), women beating her for sleeping with their husbands, and Linda's alternating neglect and affection toward him. He was excluded from pueblo rituals and traditions because he was different.

His one consolation was Linda's stories about the "Other Place" (civilization) and a book of Shakespeare's plays she gave him. Shakespeare became John's education, shaping his understanding of love, honor, beauty, and morality in ways completely alien to both cultures.

John describes his love for Kiakim√©, a pueblo girl, and his desperate attempt to prove himself worthy through suffering and tribal rituals. When he was excluded from the tribal coming-of-age ceremony, he tried to crucify himself to show his devotion.

Bernard realizes John is the Director's son - a sensational discovery that could be used against the Director, who threatened to exile Bernard to Iceland for his nonconformity.
