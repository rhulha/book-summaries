John, Helmholtz, and Bernard are brought before Mustapha Mond. The Controller proves to be highly intelligent and well-read, even knowing Shakespeare (though such books are forbidden to others).

Mond engages in a philosophical debate with John about civilization and freedom. He explains that the World State chose stability over truth and beauty. Art, science, and religion were sacrificed because they create passion, conflict, and instability. He reveals he was once a scientist who discovered dangerous truths and was given a choice: exile to an island or become a Controller and suppress such knowledge.

Mond argues that people are happier with soma, promiscuity, and trivial pleasures than they would be with freedom, art, and real emotions. The society eliminates suffering by eliminating everything that makes life meaningful.

Helmholtz accepts this analysis and actually looks forward to exile on an island where other independent thinkers live - he sees it as an opportunity for real experience and writing. Bernard, however, grovels and begs not to be exiled, revealing his cowardice.

Mond explains that islands are where they send people who are too individualistic - it's both punishment and a kind of reward, separating nonconformists from the controlled masses.
