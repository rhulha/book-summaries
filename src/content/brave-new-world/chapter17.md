After Helmholtz and Bernard are taken away, John continues his debate with Mustapha Mond. Their conversation becomes the philosophical heart of the novel.

John argues for the value of God, poetry, danger, freedom, and sin. Mond counters that religion is unnecessary when people are conditioned to be happy and never face aging, loss, or hardship. God is only needed when people suffer, and the World State has eliminated suffering.

Mond explains that Christianity and other religions required self-denial and produced passion - both dangerous to stability. The society replaced God with Ford and made happiness a right rather than something earned through struggle.

John passionately defends the right to be unhappy, to suffer, to grow old, to be free even if that means making mistakes. He claims the right to all human experiences - love, loss, danger, poetry - everything the World State has eliminated for the sake of comfort.

Mond calmly acknowledges that John is "claiming the right to be unhappy," along with the right to disease, war, fear, and all forms of human suffering. John accepts this, affirming "I claim them all."

The Controller smiles sadly and lets John go, knowing what will likely happen.
