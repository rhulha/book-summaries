Unable to live in civilization, John retreats to an abandoned lighthouse in the countryside to live as a hermit. He plans to purify himself through solitude, prayer, and self-punishment, growing his own food and making his own bow and arrows.

John practices self-flagellation, whipping himself to purge his guilt and desire - particularly his feelings for Lenina. He wants to cleanse himself of all civilized corruption.

A reporter discovers John's hideout and films him whipping himself. The footage becomes a sensation. Crowds of curiosity-seekers descend on the lighthouse, treating John's suffering as entertainment, like a particularly thrilling "feely."

Lenina arrives with the crowd. Seeing her, John's suppressed emotions explode. He attacks her with his whip while the mob watches excitedly, thinking it's a show. The crowd's frenzy triggers an orgy that John is swept into, abandoning all his principles in a moment of madness.

The next morning, John wakes to the horror of what he's done - he has become what he despised. When curious crowds arrive expecting another spectacle, they find John has hanged himself.

The novel ends with John's feet slowly twisting as his body hangs - a final surrender to the impossible conflict between his ideals and reality.
