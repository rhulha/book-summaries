Still reeling from Linda's death, John encounters a group of Delta workers receiving their soma ration at the hospital. In his grief and anger, he sees the soma distribution as the ultimate symbol of society's slavery and decides to free them.

John makes an impassioned speech about freedom and humanity, urging the Deltas to throw away their soma. He quotes Shakespeare and calls them slaves. Then he grabs the soma boxes and hurls them out the window, scattering pills everywhere.

The Deltas, conditioned to crave soma and conformity, are horrified. They attack John in a frenzy to recover their drug. A riot breaks out.

Bernard and Helmholtz arrive. Bernard hesitates, fearing the consequences, but Helmholtz immediately rushes in to help John. Together, John and Helmholtz fight the mob while Bernard dithers uselessly.

Police arrive with soma vapor and recorded hypnopaedic messages urging calm. The Voice of Reason broadcasts soothing platitudes about happiness and order. The riot is quickly suppressed.

John, Helmholtz, and Bernard (who finally joined in) are arrested and taken to meet Mustapha Mond, the World Controller, for judgment.
