Bernard, John, and Linda return to London. The Director decides to make an example of Bernard by publicly denouncing him in the Fertilizing Room before exiling him to Iceland for his unorthodox behavior.

In front of all the high-caste workers, the Director delivers a scathing speech about Bernard's heresies - his views on sport and soma, his scandalous sex-life, and his refusal to behave properly. He announces Bernard will be dismissed and transferred to Iceland as punishment for being a subverter of Order and Stability.

Just as the Director finishes his condemnation, Bernard springs his trap. He brings in Linda, now bloated and aged, shocking everyone with her grotesque appearance. Linda recognizes the Director as "Tomakin" - the man who got her pregnant twenty-five years ago on the Savage Reservation.

Then John enters and, to everyone's horror and the Director's humiliation, kneels before him calling him "father" - the ultimate obscenity in this society. The Director, utterly disgraced by the revelation that he's a father, resigns immediately and never returns to the Centre.

Bernard's revenge is complete, and he suddenly finds himself in a position of power as John's guardian.
