John refuses to attend one of Bernard's parties where the Arch-Community-Songster of Canterbury is the guest of honor. When Bernard begs him to appear, John locks himself in his room and shouts Zu√±i curses, telling Bernard to "go to hell."

Bernard's social status collapses instantly. The distinguished guests, including the Arch-Songster, are furious at being tricked into attending. They turn on Bernard viciously, remembering all his faults and heresies. His brief period of popularity evaporates, and he becomes an object of contempt again.

Lenina is devastated, believing John refused to come because he doesn't like her. She's developing genuine feelings for him - an unusual and troubling emotional attachment in this world of casual sex.

The next day, John explains his revulsion to Bernard and Helmholtz. After taking them to see Linda permanently drugged on soma, John expresses his disgust with civilization - the mindless entertainment, the feelies, the lack of genuine emotion or beauty. He quotes Miranda's line from The Tempest: "O brave new world that has such people in it," but with bitter irony.

Helmholtz and John form an instant bond, recognizing each other as kindred spirits and fellow outsiders. Bernard feels jealous and excluded from their friendship.
