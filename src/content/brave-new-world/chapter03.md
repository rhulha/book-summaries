This chapter alternates between multiple storylines. Outside in the gardens, the Director's tour observes children engaging in mandatory erotic play - sexual exploration among children is encouraged and considered normal in this society.

Mustapha Mond, the Resident Controller for Western Europe (one of the Ten World Controllers), joins the group and lectures about history. He explains why history is suppressed - the past with its families, emotions, and instability would undermine the World State's control.

Meanwhile, Lenina Crowne finishes her work shift and discusses her personal life with her friend Fanny in the women's changing room. Fanny criticizes Lenina for being too exclusive with Henry Foster and encourages her to be more promiscuous, as prolonged relationships with one person are socially disapproved.

Bernard Marx, an Alpha-Plus psychologist, is introduced as an outsider. He's physically smaller than other Alphas (rumored to be from alcohol in his blood-surrogate) and exhibits non-conformist behavior, making him unpopular.

The chapter establishes the social philosophy of the World State: "Community, Identity, Stability" achieved through promiscuity, consumption, and the drug soma for instant happiness.
