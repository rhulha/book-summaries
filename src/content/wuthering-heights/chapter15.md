Nelly arranges for Heathcliff to visit the dying Catherine while Edgar is at church. Catherine, now ethereally beautiful but clearly fading, has a passionate and painful reunion with Heathcliff filled with mutual accusations and desperate declarations of love. The two embrace violently, with Catherine blaming both Heathcliff and Edgar for breaking her heart, while Heathcliff accuses her of betraying their love by marrying Edgar. As Edgar returns home unexpectedly, Catherine refuses to release Heathcliff despite Nelly's warnings, and she faints in his arms. Heathcliff places the unconscious Catherine in Edgar's arms and reluctantly leaves, but vows to remain in the garden all night to wait for news of her condition.
