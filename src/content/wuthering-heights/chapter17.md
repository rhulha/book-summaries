On the day of Catherine's funeral, a snowstorm transforms the landscape. Isabella suddenly appears at Thrushcross Grange, bleeding and disheveled, having fled from Wuthering Heights, and she narrates the events leading to her escape. She describes how Hindley, drunk and desperate, attempted to murder Heathcliff with a gun and knife when Heathcliff returned from his vigil at Catherine's grave, but Heathcliff overpowered and brutally beat him. Isabella, witnessing Heathcliff's grief over Catherine's death, taunted him cruelly about losing Catherine, provoking him to throw a knife at her, which gave her the opportunity to flee across the moors to safety. Isabella departs for the south of England where she later gives birth to a sickly son named Linton; shortly after, news arrives that Hindley has died drunk at age twenty-seven. Heathcliff, who holds the mortgage on Wuthering Heights, becomes master of the property and takes possession of young Hareton, deliberately raising him as an ignorant, degraded servant to revenge himself on Hindley.
