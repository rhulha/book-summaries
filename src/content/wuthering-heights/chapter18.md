The narrative jumps forward twelve years to describe young Cathy's upbringing as a beautiful, spirited, but sheltered girl who has never left the boundaries of Thrushcross Grange park. On the eve of her thirteenth birthday, while Edgar is visiting the dying Isabella in London to fetch her son Linton, Cathy ventures beyond the park boundaries and reaches Wuthering Heights. Nelly finds her there happily chatting with the eighteen-year-old Hareton, who she assumes is a servant until she learns he is her cousin, which horrifies and distresses her. The encounter reveals Hareton's degraded condition under Heathcliff's deliberately cruel upbringing, as he has been kept illiterate and rough despite being the rightful heir to the property. Edgar returns with the pale, sickly Linton Heathcliff, but that very evening Joseph arrives to claim the boy for his father, and Edgar must surrender him the next morning despite knowing Heathcliff's intentions.
