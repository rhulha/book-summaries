Catherine returns from Thrushcross Grange transformed into a refined lady, elegantly dressed and mannered. Heathcliff, now dirty and neglected, feels ashamed of his appearance. When the Linton children visit for Christmas, Hindley deliberately humiliates Heathcliff. Edgar Linton makes a thoughtless comment about Heathcliff's appearance, prompting Heathcliff to throw hot applesauce at him and earning severe punishment. Catherine is torn between her refined new friends and her devotion to Heathcliff. That night, locked in the garret, Heathcliff vows revenge against Hindley. Mrs. Dean's narrative then jumps three years forward (to 1778) at Lockwood's insistence that she continue the full story.
