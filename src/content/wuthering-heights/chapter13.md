Catherine survives her brain fever but is left permanently changed, physically weak and mentally fragile, while Edgar nurses her devotedly for two months. The narrative reveals Catherine is pregnant, giving hope for an heir to Thrushcross Grange. Isabella sends a letter announcing her marriage to Heathcliff and describing her miserable arrival at Wuthering Heights, where she encounters the degraded Hindley, the hostile Joseph, and the wild young Hareton. In her detailed account, Isabella describes Heathcliff's cruel treatment, his complete contempt for her, and his confession that he married her only for revenge against Edgar. The chapter ends with Nelly learning Isabella gave birth to a son named Linton, who was sickly from birth, and that Isabella eventually died when Linton was twelve years old.
