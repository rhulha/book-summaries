Nelly visits Wuthering Heights and finds young Hareton transformed into a wild, cursing child under Heathcliff's influence. She witnesses Heathcliff embracing Isabella in the courtyard, leading to a violent confrontation between Heathcliff and Catherine about his intentions. When Edgar demands Heathcliff leave and never return, Catherine locks the door and refuses to let Edgar summon servants, throwing the key in the fire. The confrontation escalates when Edgar strikes Heathcliff, but Catherine's dramatic fit of hysteria ends the encounter, after which she locks herself in her room and refuses food for three days.
