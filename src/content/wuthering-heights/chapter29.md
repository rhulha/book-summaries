The evening after Edgar's funeral, Heathcliff arrives at Thrushcross Grange to claim Catherine, now legally under his control as Linton's wife. He coldly informs them that he has psychologically tortured Linton as punishment for helping Catherine escape. Heathcliff demands Catherine return to Wuthering Heights to care for Linton and work for her keep. When Catherine defies him, Heathcliff reveals his obsessive love for the elder Catherine, describing how he opened her coffin years ago and has been haunted by her presence ever since. He confesses to bribing the sexton to eventually remove the side of her coffin so they can be united in death. Heathcliff takes Catherine's mother's portrait and forces the young widow to accompany him back to Wuthering Heights, leaving Nelly devastated at the Grange.
