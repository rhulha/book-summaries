Nelly visits Wuthering Heights with a message from Edgar that he forgives Isabella but wants no further contact with Heathcliff's household. Heathcliff interrogates Nelly about Catherine's condition and declares his obsessive love for her, insisting she thinks of him far more than of Edgar. Despite Nelly's resistance, Heathcliff forces her to agree to deliver a letter to Catherine and arrange a secret meeting, threatening to haunt the Grange every night until he sees her. Isabella appears degraded and miserable, and Heathcliff openly expresses his contempt for his wife, admitting he married her only for revenge and describing his cruel treatment of her. Heathcliff reveals his complete lack of pity and his determination to see Catherine regardless of the consequences.
