Mrs. Dean's narrative returns to the present, noting these events occurred the previous winter. Edgar's health continues to decline as he contemplates his approaching death and worries about leaving Catherine alone. On Catherine's seventeenth birthday, Edgar defers his usual visit to his wife's grave due to rain. He writes to Linton expressing desire to see him, and Linton's eloquent reply pleads for occasional meetings with Catherine. Moved by Linton's appeals and Catherine's persuasion, Edgar reluctantly agrees to supervised meetings on the moors near the Grange. Edgar has no idea that Heathcliff is tyrannically forcing the dying Linton to pursue Catherine with apparent eagerness, as part of his scheme to gain control of both estates through their marriage.
