Lockwood, recovering from illness, asks Mrs. Dean to continue her story. She resumes the narrative: Catherine has been happily married to Edgar at Thrushcross Grange for several months. One evening, Heathcliff returns after three years' absence, transformed into a gentlemanâ€”well-dressed, refined, and wealthy. Catherine is ecstatic at his return, while Edgar is coldly polite. Heathcliff reveals he's been invited to stay at Wuthering Heights by Hindley, likely to gamble and take advantage of Hindley's weakness. Catherine is overjoyed to have Heathcliff back, believing she can maintain both relationships. However, Isabella Linton develops an infatuation with Heathcliff. Catherine warns Isabella that Heathcliff is ruthless and dangerous, but Isabella refuses to listen. Heathcliff, learning Isabella is Edgar's heir, shows a calculating interest in her, suggesting sinister intentions.
