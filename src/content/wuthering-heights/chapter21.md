Years pass, and Catherine reaches sixteen with no memory of Linton. Nelly learns that Linton lives in poor health at Wuthering Heights, where Heathcliff clearly dislikes him. On Catherine's sixteenth birthday, she and Nelly wander onto Heathcliff's land, where they encounter him and Hareton. Heathcliff manipulates them into visiting Wuthering Heights, where Catherine meets her cousin Linton for the first time since childhood. Heathcliff reveals his plan to marry the cousins so Linton can inherit, but forbids Catherine from telling her father about the visit. Despite Edgar's later explanation of Heathcliff's villainous nature, Catherine secretly begins exchanging love letters with Linton, which Nelly eventually discovers and burns.
