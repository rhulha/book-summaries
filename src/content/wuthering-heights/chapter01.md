In 1801, Mr. Lockwood, the new tenant of Thrushcross Grange, visits his landlord Mr. Heathcliff at the isolated Wuthering Heights. Heathcliff proves to be a dark, reserved, and unwelcoming man. The estate is bleak and exposed to harsh weather. During the visit, Lockwood is attacked by Heathcliff's aggressive dogs. Despite the cold reception and hostile atmosphere, Lockwood finds himself intrigued by Heathcliff's extreme reserve and decides to visit again.
