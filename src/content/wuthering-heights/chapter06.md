Hindley returns for his father's funeral with a mysterious wife, Frances. He takes control of Wuthering Heights and degrades Heathcliff to a servant, forbidding him an education and forcing him to work outdoors. Catherine and Heathcliff remain close, spending their days wild and free on the moors. One evening, they spy on Thrushcross Grange and observe the pampered Linton children, Edgar and Isabella. When discovered, Catherine is attacked by the family's bulldog. The Lintons take her in to care for her injured ankle, but Heathcliff is thrown out as a "gypsy" and sent home alone. Catherine stays at Thrushcross Grange for five weeks to recover.
