Heathcliff begins behaving strangely, refusing food and wandering at night with an expression of terrible joy and anticipation. He tells Nelly he is on the threshold of attaining his heaven and wishes to be left alone. His behavior becomes increasingly disturbed as he appears to see and communicate with an invisible presence, staring fixedly at something only he can perceive. After several days of this strange excitement and self-imposed starvation, Heathcliff is found dead in Catherine Earnshaw's old room, lying on the bed with the window open and rain pouring in. His eyes remain open with a frightful expression of exultation that cannot be closed. Heathcliff is buried according to his wishes next to Catherine Earnshaw, with the side of her coffin removed so they can mingle in death. Nelly concludes her story by revealing that Catherine and Hareton plan to marry on New Year's Day and move to Thrushcross Grange, while local people claim to see Heathcliff's ghost wandering the moors.
