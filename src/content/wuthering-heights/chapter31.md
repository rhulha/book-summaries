Lockwood visits Wuthering Heights to inform Heathcliff he will not renew his lease. He brings a note from Nelly to Catherine, which Hareton intercepts out of duty to Heathcliff. Catherine treats both Lockwood and Hareton with cold disdain, though Hareton's feelings soften and he returns the note to her. Catherine cruelly mocks Hareton's attempts to educate himself by reading, laughing at his struggles with difficult words. Lockwood tries to defend Hareton, explaining that everyone struggles when learning, but Catherine dismisses this and continues her mockery. In retaliation and humiliation, Hareton throws his precious books into Catherine's lap, declaring he never wants to see them again, and then hurls them into the fire, destroying his means of self-improvement. Heathcliff arrives and notes with disturbed fascination how much Hareton resembles the elder Catherine.
