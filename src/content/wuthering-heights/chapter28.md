On the fifth morning of Nelly's imprisonment, Zillah releases her with news that Edgar is dying. Nelly finds Linton alone, now married to Catherine and callously claiming ownership of all her possessions while revealing that Catherine is locked upstairs. Nelly returns to Thrushcross Grange where Edgar, only thirty-nine but looking much younger, lies near death. Catherine escapes Wuthering Heights and reaches home just in time to see her father, who dies blissfully while kissing her cheek. The corrupt lawyer Mr. Green, who has been bribed by Heathcliff, arrives to take control and orders all servants except Nelly dismissed. He nearly prevents Edgar from being buried beside his wife, but Edgar's will specifies this arrangement. Catherine reveals that Linton, terrified of his father, helped her escape through a window by her mother's old room.
