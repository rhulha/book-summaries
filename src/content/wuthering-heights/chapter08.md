Frances gives birth to a son, Hareton, but dies shortly afterward of consumption. Hindley becomes a violent, drunken tyrant, descending into reckless behavior. Heathcliff, mistreated by Hindley, grows increasingly bitter and savage. Catherine, now fifteen, develops a double personality: refined and courteous at Thrushcross Grange with Edgar Linton, but wild and willful at home with Heathcliff. Edgar begins courting Catherine, though she is torn between her two worlds. One day, when Edgar visits, Catherine quarrels with Heathcliff, cruelly telling him he's poor company. After Edgar arrives, tensions escalate, and Catherine loses her temper, striking both Mrs. Dean and little Hareton, and then slapping Edgar. Despite this violent display, Edgar returns and they become lovers.
