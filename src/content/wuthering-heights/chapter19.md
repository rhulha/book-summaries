Edgar sends notice that Isabella has died and Cathy eagerly anticipates meeting her cousin Linton, whom Edgar brings home from London. Linton proves to be a pale, delicate, effeminate boy who resembles Edgar but has a sickly, peevish temperament, and he immediately disappoints Cathy with his weakness and constant complaining. That evening, Joseph arrives from Wuthering Heights demanding that Linton be turned over to his father Heathcliff immediately, but Edgar insists the exhausted child will come the next day. Despite Edgar's hopes that Linton might stay at the Grange, Heathcliff's legal claim as father cannot be contested.
