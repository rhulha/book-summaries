Catherine and Nelly ride out to meet Linton, who appears dramatically worse than before, frighteningly pale and weak. Linton can barely walk or sustain conversation, yet he desperately begs Catherine to stay, clearly terrified of his father's reaction if she leaves. Catherine notices Linton's strange behavior and suspects he is being compelled to meet her against his will. Linton's fear of Heathcliff is palpable as he glances nervously toward Wuthering Heights and insists Catherine report to Edgar that he is in good health. Despite Catherine's disappointment at finding Linton so changed and unresponsive, she agrees to return the following week. Nelly observes that Linton seems to be enduring the meeting as a forced task rather than enjoying Catherine's company.
