In September 1802, Lockwood unexpectedly passes near Gimmerton and impulsively decides to visit Thrushcross Grange. He finds Mrs. Dean has moved to Wuthering Heights and learns that Heathcliff has died. At Wuthering Heights, Lockwood secretly observes Catherine teaching Hareton to read, their heads bent together in obvious affection and mutual attraction. Nelly begins recounting what happened after Lockwood left. She explains that Heathcliff summoned her to Wuthering Heights to keep Catherine company. Catherine, confined to the garden and lonely, initially tormented Hareton with cruel remarks about his ignorance and manners. However, her conscience troubled her for having destroyed his ambition to learn. Gradually, Catherine began trying to reconcile with Hareton, and on Easter Monday she made a determined effort to befriend him, eventually offering to teach him to read and giving him a beautifully wrapped book, which he tearfully accepted.
