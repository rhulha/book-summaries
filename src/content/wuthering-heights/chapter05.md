Mrs. Dean continues her narrative. As Mr. Earnshaw's health declined, he became increasingly irritable and fiercely protective of Heathcliff. To ease tensions, Hindley was sent away to college. Young Catherine was a wild, spirited, and mischievous child who adored Heathcliff and constantly tested her father's patience. One peaceful October evening, Mr. Earnshaw died quietly in his chair while Catherine sang to him. Catherine and Heathcliff were heartbroken and found comfort in each other, imagining their beloved guardian in heaven.
