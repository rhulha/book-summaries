Lockwood makes a second visit to Wuthering Heights during a snowstorm. He meets a beautiful but hostile young woman (later revealed to be Mrs. Heathcliff, widow of Heathcliff's deceased son) and a rough young man named Hareton Earnshaw. The household is cold and unwelcoming. Lockwood makes several social blunders, misunderstanding the relationships between the inhabitants. When he attempts to leave during the blizzard, he's again attacked by the dogs and suffers a nosebleed. The violent snowstorm forces him to accept lodging for the night.
