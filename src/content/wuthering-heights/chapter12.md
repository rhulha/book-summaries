Catherine remains locked in her room for three days, fasting and growing increasingly delirious as Edgar and Isabella maintain their distance. When Nelly finally enters on the third day, she finds Catherine in a fevered, half-mad state, tearing pillow feathers and experiencing hallucinations of her childhood at Wuthering Heights. Catherine's mental breakdown intensifies as she mistakes her reflection for a ghost and speaks deliriously of Heathcliff and death. Edgar finally enters and is horrified to see how seriously ill his wife has become, and Dr. Kenneth warns that permanent mental damage is a greater danger than death. Nelly discovers Isabella has eloped with Heathcliff during the night of chaos.
