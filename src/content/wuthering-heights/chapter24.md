When Nelly recovers from her illness, she discovers that Catherine has been secretly riding to Wuthering Heights every evening. Catherine confesses the whole story, revealing her nightly visits to see Linton, her developing affection for him, and several dramatic incidents including Hareton's violent outburst that caused Linton to cough up blood. Catherine describes Hareton's attempts to learn to read and her cruel mockery of his efforts, as well as Linton's manipulative and selfish behavior. Despite recognizing Linton's flaws, Catherine feels obligated to continue the relationship. Nelly betrays Catherine's confidence by immediately telling Edgar everything, and he forbids further visits to Wuthering Heights, though he offers to allow Linton to visit the Grange instead.
