Nelly takes the reluctant Linton to Wuthering Heights early the next morning, and the boy is confused and frightened to learn he has a father he never knew existed. When they arrive, Heathcliff greets his son with scorn and disgust at his weakness and resemblance to Isabella, though he declares he will keep and care for the boy since Linton is his tool for inheriting the Linton property at Thrushcross Grange. Heathcliff reveals his plan to make Linton the heir to both the Earnshaw and Linton estates, thus gaining complete revenge on both families through Linton's prospective ownership. Despite his contempt for the frail child, Heathcliff promises to preserve Linton's health and gentleman status because of his value as an heir, and Nelly departs leaving the terrified boy crying for her not to abandon him.
