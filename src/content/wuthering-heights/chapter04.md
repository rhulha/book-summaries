Mrs. Dean, who served at Wuthering Heights as a young woman, begins the family history. She recounts how Mr. Earnshaw brought home an orphan boy from Liverpool and named him Heathcliff. The Earnshaw children, Hindley and Catherine, initially resented the newcomer. However, Catherine soon became devoted to Heathcliff, while Hindley's hatred deepened. Mr. Earnshaw's obvious favoritism toward Heathcliff created lasting resentment and conflict within the household.
