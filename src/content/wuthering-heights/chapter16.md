Catherine gives birth to a premature daughter (also named Catherine) at midnight and dies two hours later without regaining consciousness. Nelly finds Heathcliff in the garden and tells him of Catherine's death, and he responds with a terrible curse, begging her ghost to haunt him rather than rest in peace. For several nights before the funeral, Heathcliff secretly enters the house to see Catherine's corpse, and Nelly discovers he has removed a lock of Edgar's hair from Catherine's locket and replaced it with his own. Catherine is buried not in the chapel with the Lintons nor with her family, but in a corner of the churchyard on the moor between both families. Edgar becomes a devoted father to baby Cathy, finding consolation in his daughter while living in seclusion and grief for his lost wife.
