Edgar Linton catches a severe cold that confines him indoors throughout the winter, weakening his health significantly. Catherine becomes melancholy after her romance with Linton is forbidden. During an autumn walk, Heathcliff intercepts Catherine and Nelly, claiming that Linton is dying of heartbreak over Catherine's abandonment. He manipulates Catherine's sympathy by insisting only she can save Linton's life. Despite Nelly's objections, Catherine's compassion is stirred by Heathcliff's claims. The next day, unable to bear the thought of Linton suffering, Nelly reluctantly accompanies Catherine to Wuthering Heights to verify Heathcliff's story.
