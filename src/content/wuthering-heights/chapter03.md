Zillah, the housekeeper, places Lockwood in a mysterious room with an enclosed oak bed. Inside, he discovers old books belonging to Catherine Earnshaw, filled with diary entries about her childhood with Heathcliff and her brother Hindley's cruelty. Lockwood falls asleep and has vivid nightmares, including a terrifying encounter with the ghost of Catherine Linton, a child's spirit trying to enter through the window. His screams wake Heathcliff, who becomes deeply distraught and desperately calls out for Catherine. The next morning, Heathcliff guides Lockwood partway home through the treacherous snow-covered moors.
