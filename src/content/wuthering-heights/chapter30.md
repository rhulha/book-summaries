Nelly attempts to visit Catherine at Wuthering Heights but is turned away by Joseph. She learns from the housekeeper Zillah about Catherine's miserable existence there. When Catherine arrived, Linton was already dying, and Heathcliff refused to call a doctor or provide any assistance. Catherine nursed Linton alone until his death, after which Heathcliff showed her Linton's will leaving all property to him. Catherine, now destitute and friendless, remains isolated upstairs for two weeks after Linton's funeral. When she finally comes downstairs, she treats Zillah and Hareton with contempt, rejecting their offers of kindness and company. Zillah describes Catherine's bitter, proud demeanor and her cruel dismissal of Hareton's attempts at friendship. Mrs. Dean's narrative ends, and Lockwood, now recovered, announces he will return to London and not renew his lease.
