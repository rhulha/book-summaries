Catherine and Hareton's friendship rapidly develops into romance as she teaches him to read and he assists with her garden. Their growing affection becomes obvious to everyone, causing Heathcliff visible distress despite his careful indifference. When Joseph discovers they have destroyed his prized currant bushes to plant flowers, he complains bitterly to Heathcliff, who barely responds. During breakfast, Heathcliff erupts in fury at Catherine for staring at him, but his anger suddenly dissipates when he nearly strikes her. Heathcliff sees the elder Catherine in both young people's eyes and faces, which torments him profoundly. He confesses to Nelly that he has lost all desire for revenge and can no longer enjoy destroying his enemies' descendants. Heathcliff describes being consumed by a strange obsession, seeing Catherine Earnshaw's image everywhere and feeling her presence constantly, making him indifferent to everything else in life.
