Hindley, drunk and violent, nearly drops baby Hareton over the banister. Heathcliff catches the child, though he later regrets saving Hindley's son. That evening, Catherine confides in Mrs. Dean that Edgar has proposed marriage and she has accepted. When asked if she loves Edgar, Catherine gives superficial reasons: his looks, wealth, and status. She admits feeling it would "degrade" her to marry Heathcliff, who has been reduced to a servant. However, she then reveals her true feelings: she loves Heathcliff more deeply than anyone, declaring "I am Heathcliff" and that their souls are the same. Unbeknownst to Catherine, Heathcliff overhears only the degrading comment and flees into the storm. Catherine searches desperately for him all night in the rain. Heathcliff disappears completely. Catherine falls ill with fever, and during her convalescence at Thrushcross Grange, Mr. and Mrs. Linton catch the fever and die. Three years later, Catherine marries Edgar, and Mrs. Dean accompanies her to Thrushcross Grange.
