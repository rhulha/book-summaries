Summary of Chapter 3

Case wakes up in a sparse factory loft in the Sprawl (the Boston-Atlanta Metropolitan Axis), his home turf. He is with Molly, and they have been brought here by their mysterious employer, Armitage, after their time in Europe.

Armitage soon appears and reveals the true nature of their arrangement. He informs Case that during his surgery, fifteen sacs of a potent mycotoxin were bonded to the lining of his major arteries. These sacs are slowly dissolving. The only way to get the antidote—an enzyme that will neutralize the sacs—is to complete the job for Armitage. If he fails or quits, the toxins will be released, returning him to the crippled state he was in before. Case is now completely dependent on Armitage.

After this revelation, Armitage provides Case with a brand new, top-of-the-line cyberspace deck (an Ono-Sendai) and other high-end gear. Later, while out in the Sprawl with Molly, she confirms she didn't know about the toxins but suggests they form an alliance to figure out who Armitage is and what his real motives are.

Molly leads Case to a secure hideout run by a shady tech-fence named The Finn. In a private, shielded room, she reveals the first part of their mission: they must steal a ROM construct of the legendary, deceased hacker McCoy Pauley, known as "The Dixie Flatline," who was one of Case's mentors. The construct is held in a high-security library at the Sense/Net corporation.

Back at the loft, Case jacks into cyberspace for the first time since his nervous system was repaired. The experience is a euphoric, almost religious release for him, as he returns to the "matrix," his "distanceless home."

The chapter ends with The Finn arriving at the loft, hired by Armitage as their tech support. He brings a new piece of hardware for Case: a custom "flipflop switch" that will allow him to toggle between the cyberspace matrix and a live Simstim feed of Molly's sensory input without having to jack out, hinting at the integrated nature of their upcoming heist.
