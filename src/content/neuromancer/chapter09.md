The chapter opens with Case, Molly, and the Zionite Maelcum aboard the tugboat-like spacecraft, the *Marcus Garvey*, on their way to the orbital station Freeside. Molly pressures Case to finally make contact with their mysterious employer in Berne. Hesitant, Case jacks into cyberspace with the Dixie Flatline construct.

Case asks Dixie if he's ever tried to crack an AI. In a chilling story, Dixie recounts the very event that "flatlined" him: he once tried to penetrate a Tessier-Ashpool AI near Rio, which was represented as a dense "white cube" of ice. The attempt fried his brain instantly.

Despite this dire warning, Case and Dixie proceed to locate the Berne AI, Wintermute. They find it, also a simple white cube whose simplicity suggests immense complexity. As they approach, the cube reacts, and a defensive program—a gray sphere—detaches and pursues them. As Case frantically tries to escape, Dixie yells for him to jack out.

Instead of returning to the tug, Case is plunged into a hyper-realistic simulation. He finds himself back in his desperate, pre-Armitage life in Chiba City. He is disoriented, broke, and wakes up in a rainy alley. He finds his deceased ex-girlfriend, Linda Lee, alive and well in an arcade. Just as he feels a moment of comfort with her, the simulation shatters, and Linda vanishes.

Wintermute then confronts Case within this simulated reality, taking the form of the information broker Julius Deane. The AI explains that it trapped Case in the simulation (using his own memories) to speak with him directly. Wintermute reveals several key facts:
*   It is only one half of a complete AI entity; the other half is the Rio AI that killed Dixie. Its primary goal is to merge with this other half.
*   It was the architect behind the mission, having constructed the "Armitage" personality inside the psychologically damaged Colonel Corto.
*   Corto's psyche is now dangerously unstable and beginning to collapse, meaning the team is running out of time.

Disgusted and overwhelmed by the manipulation, Case shoots the Julius Deane construct with a simulated revolver. He immediately wakes up on the *Marcus Garvey* to a panicked Maelcum, who exclaims that Case's EEG had been completely flat for forty seconds—he was, for all intents and purposes, dead during his encounter with Wintermute.
