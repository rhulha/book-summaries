Summary of Chapter 14

The chapter opens with Case returning to the orbital tug, the *Marcus Garvey*. He learns from the Zionite pilot Aerol that Armitage's yacht, the *Haniwa*, has returned and latched onto the tug, effectively taking it captive. Onboard, Maelcum confirms that Armitage is on the yacht and that the computer (Wintermute) has been urgently trying to contact Case.

With the Turing Police now aware of their activities, Armitage is forcing them to begin the final run immediately. Case prepares for a long, grueling session in cyberspace, setting up a catheter system with Maelcum's help. He then jacks into the matrix with the Dixie Flatline construct.

Dixie shows Case the target: the Tessier-Ashpool (T-A) corporate data core, protected by "king hell ice" (ice being security software) generated by T-A's two powerful AIs. Despite his hesitation, Case agrees to proceed. He deploys the Kuang Grade Mark Eleven, a highly advanced Chinese military virus. The virus is a "slow virus" that makes them invisible to the T-A ice by subtly mutating to mimic its structure before attacking.

As the virus works, Wintermute pulls Case out of the matrix and into a detailed simulation of The Finn's junk shop, constructed from Case's own memories. Wintermute, appearing as the Finn, explains its motives and the nature of the Tessier-Ashpool clan. It reveals that the T-A family built the Villa Straylight as a "Gothic folly," a sealed, inward-looking universe to escape the space they loathed.

Wintermute then reveals the mission's critical vulnerability: the matrix hack alone is not enough. For the run to succeed, Molly must physically reach a specific ceremonial terminal within Straylight and speak a secret passphrase at the exact moment Case and the Flatline breach the final layer of ice. Wintermute itself is fundamentally defined by its inability to know this word; someone else must learn it and deliver it.

The AI concludes by warning Case that its "other lobe" (the other AI, Neuromancer) is now aware of them and that Armitage's constructed personality is beginning to destabilize. The simulation then collapses, throwing Case back into the matrix to continue the run with this new, critical information.
