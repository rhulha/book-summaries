The chapter is split between Molly's physical infiltration of the Villa Straylight and Case's preparations in cyberspace.

Case jacks into Molly's simstim feed. Guided by Wintermute's text commands in her vision, Molly navigates a bizarre, low-gravity corridor in the Tessier-Ashpool spindle. The hallway is an illogical mix of organic curves, antique museum cases, and layers of expensive, handwoven rugs.

As she moves, Molly delivers a long, personal monologue to Case. She tells him the story of a former lover named Johnny, a data courier with memory chips in his head, who reminds her of Case. She describes their happy life together as partners in crime until the Yakuza, who are "patient like a spider," sent a silent, methodical assassin to kill him. She compares this "stone killer" to a rat catcher from her childhood, emphasizing his chilling efficiency.

Following Wintermute's directions, Molly arrives at a specific door. Because it has an old-fashioned mechanical lock, Wintermute—which excels at manipulating electronic systems—needs Molly's physical skill to open it. Inside a small storage room, she finds a specific drawer containing a brass Chubb key. Molly reveals that Wintermute told her it had orchestrated the placement of this key over a 20-year period, even arranging the death of a child who hid it, all part of its long-term plan to free itself.

The perspective briefly shifts to Case in cyberspace. He and the Dixie Flatline construct are preparing a powerful Chinese icebreaker program, "Kuang Grade Mark Eleven," for their assault on the Tessier-Ashpool's core security. They confirm their plan: while they break the ice, someone on the inside (3Jane) must speak a code word into a terminal to release Wintermute's shackles.

Back in Molly's feed, she ignores Wintermute's warnings and investigates a slurred voice. She is disabled by a neural disruptor and captured by a very old, drugged man who introduces himself as **Ashpool**, one of the family patriarchs. In a rambling, semi-lucid monologue, Ashpool reveals he is over 200 years old (counting his time in cryosleep), that he was awakened by the AIs to deal with a crisis, and that he is in the process of committing suicide. He also provides disturbing details about the family's practice of cloning, specifically how they induce a "pliable imitation of autism" in the clones.

Ashpool eventually passes out. Exploring the room, Molly discovers the freshly murdered body of a young woman—the clone (8Jean) Ashpool had thawed. At this moment, Wintermute directly manipulates Case's simstim feed: the dead girl's face morphs into the face of **Linda Lee**, Case's ex-girlfriend whom he left for dead in Chiba. This psychological attack is seen only by Case; Molly is unaware of the alteration.

Unaffected, Molly calmly retrieves her fletcher, walks over to the unconscious Ashpool, and kills him with a toxin dart to the eye before leaving the room.
