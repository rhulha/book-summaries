Case and Maelcum infiltrate Villa Straylight, which Case notes is a "parasitic structure" dependent on the Freeside spindle for all its resources. They climb a strange, vertical gangway from their tug, the *Marcus Garvey*, into a docking chamber. Guided by Wintermute (disguised as a Tessier-Ashpool family member on a monitor), they surprise a lone Eurasian technician. While Maelcum holds the man at gunpoint, Case follows instructions from the Finn (another of Wintermute's personas on a different screen) and jacks his cyberspace deck into the Villa's internal systems.

Inside the matrix, Case meets the Flatline construct. They see that their icebreaker, the Kuang virus, is successfully shielding them from the formidable Tessier-Ashpool ICE, which appears as a "black-mirrored shark."

The perspective then flips to Molly, whom Case is connected to. She is seriously injured and strapped to a table, being tended to by 3Jane, the current head of the Tessier-Ashpool clan. In a disturbing mix of care and menace, 3Jane reveals several critical pieces of information:
*   She murdered her own father by manipulating his cryogenic systems.
*   She knows Wintermute is one of the family's two AIs. She reveals there is a **second AI**, but it has been silent for years.
*   Her mother was the visionary who commissioned the AIs, hoping to merge the family into an immortal "hive" entity guided by the artificial intelligences. This plan died with her.
*   She confirms that she knows the secret code word that Wintermute needs to merge with the other AI, but she is hesitant to give it up.

During their conversation, Peter Riviera taunts Molly with a gruesome hologram of her shattered eye socket, but 3Jane calmly orders him to stop, demonstrating her authority.

Case jacks out of the matrix, now aware of 3Jane's location and her knowledge of the code. The Finn informs them that their transport is ready. A riderless service cart, guided by the small Braun robot from the heist, arrives to take them deeper into the Villa to confront 3Jane.
