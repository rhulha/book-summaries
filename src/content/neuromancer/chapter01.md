The chapter introduces the protagonist, Henry Dorsett Case, a washed-up but once-brilliant "cyberspace cowboy" (a futuristic hacker) living in the dystopian underworld of Chiba City, Japan. His career was destroyed when he stole from his employers, who retaliated not by killing him, but by using a mycotoxin to damage his nervous system, permanently severing his ability to connect to the matrix—the global, consensual virtual reality network. Now trapped in his physical body, which he despises as "meat," Case is broke, addicted to drugs, and harbors a deep-seated death wish, surviving as a low-level hustler in the dangerous district of Night City.

The narrative follows Case through a single, paranoid night. He is warned by his ex-girlfriend, Linda Lee, that a powerful dealer named Wage wants him killed over a debt. This sends Case on a frantic spiral: he visits Julius Deane, a 135-year-old information broker, who gives him no clear answers. He soon realizes he is being followed by a mysterious, slender figure with mirrored glasses. Convinced this is Wage's assassin, Case tries to ambush them in an arcade, but the plan goes awry and he barely escapes.

He arms himself with a cheap pistol and confronts Wage at the Chatsubo bar, only to discover that Wage has no intention of killing him. Case realizes Linda Lee lied about the threat as a ruse to steal his last valuable asset—three megabytes of hot RAM—to buy herself a ticket out of Chiba.

Defeated and drained, Case returns to his rented "coffin" hotel room to find the mysterious figure waiting for him. She introduces herself as Molly, a "street samurai" with surgically inset mirror-lenses for eyes. She reveals her own deadly modifications—retractable, double-edged scalpel blades under her fingernails—and informs Case that her powerful employer wants to hire him. She has been sent to "collect" him, setting up the main plot of the novel.
