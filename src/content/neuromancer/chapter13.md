Summary of Chapter 13

Case finds himself in his hotel room confronted by three agents—Michele, Roland, and Pierre—who know his entire personal history, including his real name and past aliases. They reveal they are from the Turing Registry, the agency that polices artificial intelligences, and inform him that Armitage (whose real name they confirm is Corto) is already in their custody.

The agents interrogate Case, who is weak and suffering from a drug comedown. They demonstrate a comprehensive knowledge of the entire operation, revealing they know about the illegal surgery in Chiba, the theft of the McCoy Pauley ROM construct from Sense/Net, and the ultimate goal of the mission: to illegally augment an AI. For the first time, they name the AI for Case: **Wintermute**.

Michele gives Case an ultimatum: he can cooperate and travel with them to Switzerland to testify against Wintermute, or they will extradite him to the BAMA to face charges of data theft and responsibility for deaths during the Sense/Net riot. Feeling defeated and cornered, Case agrees to go with them.

As they escort him across a bridge in Freeside, they are suddenly and brutally attacked. A silent microlight aircraft decapitates Pierre with its propeller. In the ensuing chaos, Case runs as the microlight crashes, taking Michele with it over the side of the bridge. When Roland, the last agent, pursues Case, a "gardening robot" drops from a tree and kills him. Running in shock, Case realizes the entire violent, coordinated attack was orchestrated by Wintermute to free him.
