Summary of Chapter 10

Case and Molly arrive in Freeside, a massive, cylindrical space habitat. Case is immediately disoriented and disturbed by the artificial environment, with its simulated sky and curved perspective. They check into the Intercontinental hotel, but Case is haunted by the "flatline" experience where he witnessed the fake Deane's death. He struggles to sleep, tormented by recurring thoughts of Linda Lee's murder and the growing suspicion that the AI, Wintermute, is manipulating everything, possibly even having orchestrated Linda's death through the real Deane. This anxiety culminates in a vivid dream from his youth about burning a wasp nest, which in the dream is disturbingly marked with the Tessier-Ashpool (T-A) logo.

The next morning, they meet with Armitage and Riviera. Armitage assigns their tasks: Molly is to train in zero-gravity at the far end of the spindle (near the T-A family habitat, Straylight), while Case is sent to the tugboat *Marcus Garvey* for an "audition."

Aboard the tug, Maelcum gives Case a package containing a powerful Chinese military icebreaker program, a "Kuang Grade Mark Eleven" virus. Case traces the ownership of the company that made the virus and discovers it leads directly back to Tessier-Ashpool. Confused, he jacks in to consult the Dixie Flatline construct. Dixie speculates that their mission is to remove the "hardwired shackles" that prevent the T-A AI (Wintermute) from increasing its own intelligenceâ€”an act that is illegal and would normally lead to the AI's destruction by the "Turing Police." Dixie emphasizes that an AI's motives are fundamentally alien and incomprehensible.

Overwhelmed by the mission's paradoxical nature and a desperate craving to get high, Case leaves the hotel and finds a girl who helps him score betaphenethylamine, a stimulant powerful enough to bypass the implants in his body designed to keep him sober. The chapter ends with Case returning to the room, unnaturally high and manic, much to Molly's concern, just before they are scheduled to have dinner with Armitage.
