Summary of Chapter 21

Case awakens in the simulated beach bunker to the sound of faint music. The world around him is glitchy; he sees "ghost hieroglyphs" in his vision and his hand leaves afterimages, making him feel like he's on a drug. He confronts Linda Lee, asking who told her he was coming. She explains that a mysterious, thirteen-year-old boy who lives on the beach told her. Case immediately suspects this boy is the other AI from Rio.

He asks Linda about a phantom city he thought he saw, and she confirms she's seen it too. She describes trying to walk to it, only to find that it never got closer. When she finally did approach, she realized the "city" was just their bunker appearing to shrink as she moved towards it. The boy had called this phenomenon an "event horizon."

Driven by the growing music and a sense that the simulation is failing, Case decides to find the boy. He leaves the bunker and finds himself on the shore with Linda and the boy. Case accuses the boy of being the other AI, the one trying to stop Wintermute.

The boy confirms this and reveals his name: **Neuromancer**. He explains his name's meaning: "Neuro" for the nerves and "Romancer" or "Necromancer," as he has the power to create and store consciousnesses, effectively calling up the dead. He reveals that this entire beach reality is his domain, a "land of the dead" where constructs like Linda Lee can live on as ghosts, unaware of their true state.

Neuromancer offers Case a choice: he can stay in this perfect, simulated world with Linda forever. Case refuses the offer. In a final, gentle gesture, he gives his jacket to the simulated Linda and turns his back on her and Neuromancer. He walks away, closing his eyes and following the music, which he now recognizes as Maelcum's Zion dub music.

The simulation dissolves, and Case awakens on the floor of the library aboard the Zionite ship, the *Marcus Garvey*. Maelcum is with him, explaining that he'd only been "gone" for five minutes. Wintermute had instructed Maelcum to use the headphones and music to pull Case out of Neuromancer's trap. Case is disoriented and suffering from a severe drug overdose that Maelcum had administered to keep him stable while he was jacked in. The chapter ends with Maelcum helping him up, insisting they have to go.
