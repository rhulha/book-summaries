Summary of Chapter 4

This chapter details the heist on the Sense/Net corporation to steal the construct of the legendary hacker, McCoy Pauley, also known as the "Dixie Flatline."

The chapter opens with Case preparing for the mission, linking with Molly via Simstim, a technology he dislikes as a "meat toy" but is essential for the job. Through her senses, he experiences her moving through the crowded streets of the Sprawl to a software black market to finalize plans.

The heist begins with a multi-pronged attack. The **Panther Moderns**, a nihilistic and tech-savvy youth subculture hired for the job, create a massive diversion. They first call in a fake bioterror threat (a psychoactive agent called Blue Nine) to multiple police agencies. Then, they hijack Sense/Net's internal video system, broadcasting a disturbing message about a bone-growth agent that causes mass panic and chaos inside the building.

Simultaneously, Case jacks into cyberspace and executes his part of the mission. He uses his custom-built icebreaker program to masterfully slice through Sense/Net's formidable security ("ice"), creating a secret entry point.

He then flips back and forth between cyberspace and the Simstim link to Molly. Through her eyes, he watches her infiltrate the building, disable a guard, and head for the sub-basement. The mission hits a critical snag when Molly is ambushed by security guards and suffers a broken leg. Case experiences the blinding pain of the injury through the Simstim link, a shocking and visceral moment for him. Despite the agony, Molly uses a powerful endorphin analog patch to numb the pain and push forward.

Guided by Case, the injured Molly reaches the secure library, retrieves the Dixie Flatline construct (a black cartridge), and makes her way back to the lobby. The lobby is now a scene of utter carnage, with panicked employees trapped between the internal chaos and the external police barricades. The Panther Moderns, camouflaged in chameleon suits, meet Molly and guide her out before she collapses.

Later, the Panther Moderns' eccentric leader, Lupus Yonderboy, meets with Case and Armitage to receive payment, callously dismissing the chaos they caused as their "mode and modus." After the meeting, a restless Case wanders the streets, where he is suddenly confronted by Yonderboy again, who delivers a cryptic, one-word message before vanishing: **"Wintermute."**
