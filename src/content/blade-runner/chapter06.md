### **Summary of Chapter 06**

John Isidore, a resident of a nearly deserted apartment building, hears a television in the unit below him. Excited by the prospect of a neighbor, he knocks on the door, bringing a cube of margarine as a welcoming gift. The TV abruptly goes silent, and a terrified young woman answers. Isidore learns she thought the building was completely abandoned.

As they talk, Isidore notices the woman is unfamiliar with the famous TV personality Buster Friendly. He also sees her apartment is in a state of advanced decay, which he explains with his personal theory of "kipple"â€”useless junk that relentlessly accumulates and takes over when unopposed. He posits that the entire universe is succumbing to "kippleization," and that the spiritual struggle of Mercerism is the only force that pushes back against this decay.

The conversation turns when Isidore mentions his empathy box, inadvertently revealing that he is a "special" (or "chickenhead"), someone who failed the minimum IQ test. The woman's fear immediately transforms into cold contempt, calling his status a "major objection to Mercerism."

Hurt by her reaction, Isidore starts to leave. However, the woman stops him, pragmatically realizing she needs his help to scavenge furniture from the other empty apartments. She coldly rejects his friendly offer to have dinner together. When he asks her name, she gives a series of contradictory answers: she first says she is "Rachael Rosen," but when Isidore connects the name to the famous android manufacturing corporation, she angrily denies it, insults his intelligence, and then claims her name is "Pris Stratton." She instructs him to call her Miss Stratton and shuts the door, leaving Isidore alone and confused in the hallway.
