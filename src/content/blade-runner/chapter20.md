After killing the last of the Nexus-6 androids, Rick Deckard speaks briefly with his boss, Harry Bryant, and then dismisses the horrified J.R. Isidore, who wants nothing to do with him. Overcome with self-loathing, Rick sees himself as a "scourge, like famine or plague," and feels that everything he has done is wrong, echoing the teachings of Mercer.

He returns home to find his wife, Iran, waiting for him on the roof with devastating news: his new goat is dead. Iran explains that she witnessed a young woman, whom Rick immediately identifies as Rachael Rosen, deliberately push the animal off the roof. Rick understands this was a calculated act of revenge for his having continued his job after sleeping with her.

When Iran mentions a TV report claiming Mercer is a fake, a spiritually and emotionally shattered Rick gives a bleak, nihilistic response: "Everything is true." Believing he is going to die, he gets into his hovercar and, ignoring Iran's pleas, flies away from the city, heading north toward the uninhabited, desolate wasteland.
