Of course. Here is a summary of Chapter 12 of *Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?*

### Summary of Chapter 12

Rick Deckard and Phil Resch track the android Luba Luft to a museum where she is viewing an Edvard Munch exhibit. As they search, Resch, plagued by doubt about his own identity, is deeply disturbed by Munch's painting "The Scream," remarking, "this is how an andy must feel."

They find Luba absorbed by the painting "Puberty." When they confront her, she is shocked to see Rick free and immediately accuses Resch of being an android, just like her. As they escort her to the elevator, Luba asks Rick to buy her a book of Munch's art. In a surprising act of empathy, Rick buys the expensive book for her with his own money.

In the elevator, Luba thanks Rick, noting that a real android like Resch would never have done such a thing. She relentlessly taunts Resch about being an android trying to imitate a superior human life form. Resch snaps, pulls his laser gun, and shoots Luba. To end her screaming and suffering, Rick delivers the final shot himself. He then methodically burns the art book he just bought for her.

Shaken, Rick declares he is quitting bounty hunting, disturbed by the killing of a talented artist. Resch argues for the necessity of their work. Desperate to know the truth about himself, Resch agrees to be tested. In Resch's car, Rick administers the Voigt-Kampff test and confirms that **Phil Resch is human.**

The revelation is unsettling. Rick concludes that Resch has a defect in his empathy *toward androids*, a coldness that allows him to kill so easily. To confirm this, Rick tests himself, imagining Luba's death, and discovers he has a strong empathetic response. He realizes that his own feelings are considered "abnormal" for a bounty hunter.

Resch dismisses Rick's empathy as simple sexual attraction, offering the chilling advice to "go to bed with her firstâ€”and then kill her." The chapter ends with Rick, for the first time, profoundly questioning his own humanity and his fitness for the job.
