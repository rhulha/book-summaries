Of course. Here is a summary of Chapter 9 of *Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?*

### **Chapter 9 Summary**

Rick Deckard tracks his third target, the Nexus-6 android Luba Luft, to an opera house where she is rehearsing Mozart's *The Magic Flute*. As he watches, Deckard muses on mortality and entropy, seeing himself as a "form-destroyer" who un-creates the androids that the Rosen Association builds.

He confronts Luba in her dressing room to administer the Voigt-Kampff empathy test. Luba proves to be exceptionally clever and manipulative. She skillfully derails the test by feigning ignorance of basic words (like "wasp"), questioning the morality of the scenarios, and then turning the tables by accusing Deckard of being an android himself, since his job requires a lack of empathy. She demands that he take the test first to prove his own humanity.

When Deckard's questions become more personal, Luba accuses him of being a sexual deviant, pulls a laser tube on him, and calls the police. Deckard is initially relieved, believing this action proves she's human. However, the arriving officer, a "harness bull" named Crams, claims he has never heard of Deckard or his superior, Inspector Bryant. When Deckard gets Bryant on the vidphone, the line mysteriously cuts out, and Crams insists no one was there. Crams then "confirms" with his own headquarters that Deckard is not a police officer.

Crams arrests Deckard. After seeing the body of the previously retired android (Polokov) in Deckard's car, he drives Deckard away. Deckard soon realizes they are heading in the wrong direction. Crams informs him that the Hall of Justice he knows has been abandoned for years and they are going to a new one. In this moment, Deckard understands he has been captured by a highly organized group of androids and that Officer Crams is one of them, leaving him a helpless prisoner.
