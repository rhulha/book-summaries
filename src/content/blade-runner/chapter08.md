### **Chapter 08 Summary**

Bounty hunter Rick Deckard returns to his superior Harry Bryant's office after his trip to Seattle. Bryant informs him that his first target will be Polokov, the android who injured the previous bounty hunter, Dave Holden. Polokov is cleverly disguised as a "special" (a human with mental deficiencies) working as a trash collector. Bryant also tells Rick that a Soviet police officer, Sandor Kadalyi, is arriving to observe and possibly assist him, though Rick will not have to share the bounty.

Rick, preferring to work alone, immediately sets out to find Polokov. He first visits Polokov's workplace, the Bay Area Scavengers Company, but learns he didn't show up for work. Next, he goes to Polokov's grimy apartment, only to find it abandoned, confirming his fear that the android has fled.

Reporting his failure to Bryant, Rick is told that the Soviet cop, Kadalyi, has arrived early and will meet him at his current location. While waiting, Rick receives an unexpected call from Rachael Rosen. She warns him that the Nexus-6 androids are too dangerous for him to handle alone and offers to assist him, an offer he curtly dismisses.

Immediately after, a man arrives introducing himself as Sandor Kadalyi. He shows Rick a strange, custom-made laser pistol and encourages him to test it. When Rick pulls the trigger, nothing happens. In a moment of clarity, Rick realizes this is a trap and that the man is not Kadalyi, but the android Polokov in disguise. Rick's car is equipped with a device that neutralizes the laser, and when Polokov attacks him physically, Rick shoots and "retires" him with his .38 magnum pistol.

Shaken but successful, Rick collects his first $1,000 bounty. He calls his wife, Iran, to share the news, but she is lost in a deep, self-induced depression and is completely unresponsive. Frustrated by her emotional emptiness, Rick reflects that most androids seem to have more desire to live than his wife. This encounter, combined with Rachael's accurate warning about the Nexus-6's cunning, makes him reconsider her offer of help.

For now, however, he decides to tackle the next android on his list, an opera singer named Luba Luft, on his own. Filled with a renewed sense of purpose and anticipation, he heads for the opera house.
