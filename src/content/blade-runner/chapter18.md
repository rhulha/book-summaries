Feeling happy and useful for the first time in his life, J.R. Isidore helps the three androids—Pris, Roy, and Irmgard—by bringing Pris's TV set up to his apartment. They are all eager to watch a special broadcast by Buster Friendly, who is about to reveal a major exposé.

As he makes a second trip to get Pris's remaining belongings, Isidore finds a real, live spider, an incredibly rare and valuable discovery. Overjoyed, he carefully captures it and proudly shows it to the androids just as Buster Friendly's show begins.

The chapter then cuts between two horrifying events:

1.  **On the TV screen,** Buster Friendly systematically deconstructs the religion of Mercerism. He presents evidence that Wilbur Mercer is actually a washed-up bit-part actor named Al Jarry. The desolate landscape Mercer climbs is revealed to be a cheap Hollywood soundstage, the rocks thrown at him are plastic, and his suffering is faked. The androids watch this with triumph, as it "proves" that the human capacity for shared empathy, the core of Mercerism, is a manufactured swindle. They reveal to Isidore that Buster Friendly is also an android, and this broadcast is a calculated attack on human belief.

2.  **In the kitchen,** Pris becomes fascinated by the spider. Expressing cold curiosity, she begins to systematically cut off its legs one by one with a pair of cuticle scissors to see if it can still walk. Isidore is paralyzed with terror and begs her to stop, but she ignores him.

Devastated by both the androids' casual cruelty and the public destruction of his faith, Isidore takes the mutilated spider and drowns it in the sink to end its suffering. He falls into a state of profound despair, and his apartment seems to dissolve into "kipple" (entropy and decay) around him. He has a vision where he is transported to the barren "tomb world" of the Mercer experience.

In this vision, he calls out for Mercer, who appears before him. Isidore confronts him about the broadcast, and Mercer calmly admits that everything Buster Friendly said is true—he *is* a fraud from a factual standpoint. However, Mercer explains that the experience of empathy and connection is still real, stating, "They will have trouble understanding why nothing has changed. Because you're still here and I'm still here." He then magically restores the spider's legs and returns it to Isidore.

The vision is abruptly shattered by an alarm bell. Roy Baty shouts that a bounty hunter is in the building, ending the chapter on a tense cliffhanger.
