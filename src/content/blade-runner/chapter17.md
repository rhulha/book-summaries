After sleeping with Rachael, Rick Deckard feels a genuine emotional connection to her, even telling her he would marry her if she were human. The mood shifts dramatically during their subsequent hovercar ride. Rachael reveals the devastating truth: their intimacy was a calculated tactic employed by the Rosen Association. She explains that she has slept with nine bounty hunters before him to instill empathy and make them emotionally incapable of "retiring" any more androids, a method that has worked on all but the cynical Phil Resch.

Feeling betrayed and fearing his career is over, Rick reacts with fury. To prove to himself that he can still do his job, he decides he must kill Rachael. He lands the car and prepares to shoot her, but he is stopped by her reaction. Instead of fighting, she displays a "classic resignation"—a mechanical, intellectual acceptance of death that he finds deeply disturbing and inhuman. Disgusted by this lack of a will to live, he finds he cannot kill her.

Realizing she is safe, Rachael's demeanor becomes smug and triumphant. She taunts Rick, declaring that he has failed her test and will no longer be able to hunt the remaining androids. The chapter ends with Rachael turning on the radio to listen to a major exposé by Buster Friendly, her glowing cigarette symbolizing her victory over the now silent and defeated Rick.
