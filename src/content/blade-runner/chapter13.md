### Summary of Chapter 13

John R. Isidore, filled with hopeful excitement, uses two weeks of advanced salary to buy rare and luxurious food—peaches, cheese, and a bottle of Chablis wine—to share with his new neighbor, Pris Stratton. When he arrives at her apartment, she is initially suspicious but then delighted by the food, only to have her mood suddenly crash into bitterness and despair, telling him the feast is "wasted" on her.

When Isidore suggests her misery is due to loneliness, Pris reveals the true source of her terror: she and her seven friends are fugitives from Mars, being systematically hunted and killed by professional "bounty hunters." Isidore, completely unaware of this reality, is shocked and thinks she must be delusional, citing Mercerian ethics that "all life is one." He compassionately offers to get a gun and protect her.

As they begin to eat, Pris makes a telling slip about something an "android" would say, strongly hinting at her true nature. She then opens up about the profound loneliness of life on Mars, which drove her and her friends to escape. She explains their main solace on Mars was smuggling and reading "pre-colonial fiction"—old science fiction stories from before space travel was a reality—which allowed them to imagine a better world with cities, successful colonies, and no radioactive dust.

Their conversation is abruptly interrupted by a knock on the door, which sends Pris into a state of pure panic. A man's voice calls out, identifying himself and his companion as "Roy and Irmgard." Terrified it's a trap, Pris forces Isidore to answer the door. He opens it to find a man and a woman, who are indeed revealed to be Pris's friends, Roy and Irmgard Baty. The chapter ends as the androids are joyfully reunited, with the unsuspecting Isidore now harboring three of the fugitives.
