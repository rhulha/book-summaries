Of course. Here is a summary of Chapter 11 of *Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?*

### Summary of Chapter 11

As bounty hunter Phil Resch leaves to get the "Boneli" testing equipment, Inspector Garland reveals the truth to Rick Deckard. He confesses that not only is he an android, but the entire police station is a fake, "closed loop" organization run by a group of escaped androids. The most shocking revelation is that Phil Resch is also an android, but he doesn't know it because he was given a synthetic memory system to make him believe he is human.

When Resch returns, Garland attempts to shoot him. However, Resch, with the superior reflexes of a bounty hunter, instantly reacts and kills Garland instead, blowing his head apart with a laser beam. Unaware of his own nature, Resch is relieved to have eliminated the android threat.

Deckard, choosing to protect Resch for the moment, lies and says Garland only revealed his own android identity. To escape the android-filled building, Resch props Garland's body up at his desk and handcuffs himself to Deckard, pretending to be a bounty hunter escorting a prisoner. They successfully reach Resch's hovercar on the roof.

During the flight, Resch's confidence begins to crumble. He starts piecing together the timeline of his employment under Garland and realizes the horrifying possibility that he might have a false memory systemâ€”a trait he knows is unique to androids. In growing torment, he asks Deckard to administer an empathy test on him after they retire their next target, Luba Luft. To prove his humanity to himself and Deckard, he talks lovingly about his real pet squirrel, Buffy, an animal he cares for deeply. The chapter ends with this unresolved tension as they fly toward the opera house.
