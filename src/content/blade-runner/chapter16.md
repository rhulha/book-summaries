Rick Deckard is in his hotel room studying the files on the three remaining Nexus-6 androids: Roy Baty, Irmgard Baty, and Pris Stratton. He is particularly disturbed by the profile of Roy Baty, the group's aggressive and pseudo-mystical leader.

Rachael Rosen arrives unexpectedly, having flown down from Seattle. She brings a bottle of expensive, pre-war bourbon. After reading the androids' files, she becomes pale and visibly shaken. She reveals the reason for her distress: the android Pris Stratton is the exact same model as her. This discovery triggers an existential crisis for Rachael, who laments that androids are just "machines, stamped out like bottle caps," and expresses a newfound empathy and fear for her android double.

As they drink, Rachael's mood shifts from morose to seductive and taunting. She reveals the Rosen Association's true plan: for her to observe Rick in order to help them build a Nexus-7 model that will be indistinguishable from humans. She attempts to dissuade him from hunting the remaining androids and coaxes him toward bed, claiming she is too drunk to help him and doesn't care if Roy Baty kills him.

Just as Rick is about to sleep with her, he has a moral crisis, realizing he cannot be intimate with Rachael and then go kill her exact duplicate. He pulls away, saying, "I can't do it." In a moment of desperation, Rachael makes a startling offer: if he will go to bed with her, she will retire Pris Stratton for him. Overwhelmed with gratitude and relief, Rick agrees, believing his job has just become significantly easier. The chapter ends with him getting into bed with her.
