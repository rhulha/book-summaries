Rick Deckard is taken to the Mission Street Hall of Justice, a police headquarters he has never seen before, creating a profound sense of disorientation. He is booked on several serious charges, including impersonating an officer and suspected homicide, as the police don't believe his claim that the body in his car (Polokov) is an android.

His confusion deepens when he is allowed to call his wife, Iran, but a strange woman he's never seen before answers his home phone. He is then interrogated by a senior official, Inspector Garland, who reveals that this police department has its own bounty hunters and is completely unaware of Rick's agency, suggesting the existence of a parallel police force.

The situation escalates dramatically when Garland examines Rick's briefcase and discovers his own name on Rick's list of androids to be "retired." To investigate, Garland calls in his department's top bounty hunter, Phil Resch. A tense conversation ensues where Resch admits he has long been suspicious of certain colleagues, including Polokov.

The turning point comes when a lab report on Polokov's body confirms he was a humanoid robot, validating Rick's story. With his own list now proven at least partially accurate, Rick, supported by the suspicious Phil Resch, insists that Inspector Garland must now be tested, putting the inspector on the defensive and ending the chapter on a tense cliffhanger.
