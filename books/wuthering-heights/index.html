      <div class="chapter-content">
        In 1801, Mr. Lockwood, the new tenant of Thrushcross Grange, visits his landlord Mr. Heathcliff at the isolated Wuthering Heights. Heathcliff proves to be a dark, reserved, and unwelcoming man. The estate is bleak and exposed to harsh weather. During the visit, Lockwood is attacked by Heathcliff's aggressive dogs. Despite the cold reception and hostile atmosphere, Lockwood finds himself intrigued by Heathcliff's extreme reserve and decides to visit again.

        Lockwood makes a second visit to Wuthering Heights during a snowstorm. He meets a beautiful but hostile young woman (later revealed to be Mrs. Heathcliff, widow of Heathcliff's deceased son) and a rough young man named Hareton Earnshaw. The household is cold and unwelcoming. Lockwood makes several social blunders, misunderstanding the relationships between the inhabitants. When he attempts to leave during the blizzard, he's again attacked by the dogs and suffers a nosebleed. The violent snowstorm forces him to accept lodging for the night.

        Zillah, the housekeeper, places Lockwood in a mysterious room with an enclosed oak bed.

Lockwood falls asleep and has vivid nightmares, including a terrifying encounter with the ghost of Catherine Linton, a child's spirit trying to enter through the window. His screams wake Heathcliff, who becomes deeply distraught and desperately calls out for Catherine.

        Recovering at Thrushcross Grange, Lockwood asks his housekeeper Mrs. Dean to explain the strange inhabitants of Wuthering Heights. Mrs. Dean, who served at Wuthering Heights as a young woman, begins the family history. She recounts how Mr. Earnshaw brought home an orphan boy from Liverpool and named him Heathcliff. The Earnshaw children, Hindley and Catherine, initially resented the newcomer. However, Catherine soon became devoted to Heathcliff, while Hindley's hatred deepened. Mr. Earnshaw's obvious favoritism toward Heathcliff created lasting resentment and conflict within the household.

        Mrs. Dean continues her narrative. As Mr. Earnshaw's health declined, he became increasingly irritable and fiercely protective of Heathcliff. To ease tensions, Hindley was sent away to college. Young Catherine was a wild, spirited, and mischievous child who adored Heathcliff and constantly tested her father's patience. One peaceful October evening, Mr. Earnshaw died quietly in his chair while Catherine sang to him. Catherine and Heathcliff were heartbroken and found comfort in each other, imagining their beloved guardian in heaven.

        Hindley returns for his father's funeral with a mysterious wife, Frances. He takes control of Wuthering Heights and degrades Heathcliff to a servant, forbidding him an education and forcing him to work outdoors. Catherine and Heathcliff remain close, spending their days wild and free on the moors. One evening, they spy on Thrushcross Grange and observe the pampered Linton children, Edgar and Isabella. When discovered, Catherine is attacked by the family's bulldog. The Lintons take her in to care for her injured ankle, but Heathcliff is thrown out as a "gypsy" and sent home alone.

        Catherine returns from Thrushcross Grange transformed into a refined lady, elegantly dressed and mannered. Heathcliff, now dirty and neglected, feels ashamed of his appearance. When the Linton children visit for Christmas, Hindley deliberately humiliates Heathcliff.

Catherine is torn between her refined new friends and her devotion to Heathcliff. That night, locked in the garret, Heathcliff vows revenge against Hindley.

Heathcliff, mistreated by Hindley, grows increasingly bitter and savage. Catherine, now fifteen, develops a double personality: refined and courteous at Thrushcross Grange with Edgar Linton, but wild and willful at home with Heathcliff. Edgar begins courting Catherine, though she is torn between her two worlds. One day, when Edgar visits, Catherine quarrels with Heathcliff, cruelly telling him he's poor company. After Edgar arrives, tensions escalate, and Catherine loses her temper, striking both Mrs. Dean and little Hareton, and then slapping Edgar.

        Hindley, drunk and violent, nearly drops baby Hareton over the banister. Heathcliff catches the child, though he later regrets saving Hindley's son. That evening, Catherine confides in Mrs. Dean that Edgar has proposed marriage and she has accepted. When asked if she loves Edgar, Catherine gives superficial reasons: his looks, wealth, and status. She admits feeling it would "degrade" her to marry Heathcliff, who has been reduced to a servant. However, she then reveals her true feelings: she loves Heathcliff more deeply than anyone, declaring "I am Heathcliff" and that their souls are the same. Unbeknownst to Catherine, Heathcliff overhears only the degrading comment and flees into the storm. Catherine searches desperately for him all night in the rain. Heathcliff disappears completely. Catherine falls ill with fever, and during her convalescence at Thrushcross Grange, Mr. and Mrs. Linton catch the fever and die.

Isabella, witnessing Heathcliff's grief over Catherine's death, taunted him cruelly about losing Catherine, provoking him to throw a knife at her, which gave her the opportunity to flee across the moors to safety.

      <h2>Chapter 34</h2>
      <div class="chapter-content">
        Heathcliff begins behaving strangely, refusing food and wandering at night with an expression of terrible joy and anticipation. He tells Nelly he is on the threshold of attaining his heaven and wishes to be left alone. His behavior becomes increasingly disturbed as he appears to see and communicate with an invisible presence, staring fixedly at something only he can perceive. After several days of this strange excitement and self-imposed starvation, Heathcliff is found dead in Catherine Earnshaw's old room, lying on the bed with the window open and rain pouring in. His eyes remain open with a frightful expression of exultation that cannot be closed. Heathcliff is buried according to his wishes next to Catherine Earnshaw, with the side of her coffin removed so they can mingle in death. Nelly concludes her story by revealing that Catherine and Hareton plan to marry on New Year's Day and move to Thrushcross Grange, while local people claim to see Heathcliff's ghost wandering the moors.
